I would like your help debugging the fact that the ebible.py script doesn't seem to write the vrs files to the project folder. This means that the calculation of the versification falls back to the default "English".


Gemini
Okay, I can help you look into why the project-specific .vrs files might not be getting written, leading to the fallback to the "English" versification.

Based on the code provided, the ebible.py script calls the unzip_and_process_files function, which in turn calls generate_vrs_from_project (defined within settings_file.py) for each project after unzipping. The write_settings_file function, called subsequently, then attempts to load this generated .vrs file using get_versification_with_scoring.

The generate_vrs_from_project function in settings_file.py already includes some logging and error handling. It returns None if it fails to initialize the ParatextTextCorpus, if no verse references are found, or if no valid verse data is collected. In these cases, the .vrs file will not be written.

The most likely reason the .vrs file isn't being written for a specific project is that the ParatextTextCorpus cannot successfully read and process the SFM files within that project directory. This could happen if the directory is empty, contains no valid SFM files, or if there's an unexpected format issue.

To better diagnose this, we can enhance the logging within the generate_vrs_from_project function in settings_file.py to provide more detail about why it might be failing or returning early without writing the file.

Here's a suggested change to c:\ebible_code\ebible_code\settings_file.py to add more detailed logging:

 logger.debug(f"Collected verse data for {project_name}: {len(verse_data)} books, {sum(len(chaps) for chaps in verse_data.values())} chapters with verses.")

        try:

 logger.debug(f"  Writing VRS line: {line}")

        logger.info(f"Successfully generated VRS file: {vrs_filepath}")
        return vrs_filepath

Explanation of Changes:

More Debug Logs: Added logger.debug calls at key stages:
Before and after initializing ParatextTextCorpus.
After iterating through the corpus to show how many verse references were processed.
After collecting verse data to show how much data was gathered.
Before writing each line to the .vrs file (this might be verbose, but useful for deep debugging).
Clarity in Warnings: The existing warnings for 0 processed refs or 0 valid data points are kept, as they are the primary indicators that the .vrs file won't be generated.
How to Debug:

Apply the Diff: Save the changes to your settings_file.py.
Run ebible.py: Execute the ebible.py script with the translations you expect to have .vrs files generated for. Make sure your logging level is set to DEBUG in ebible.py (the provided code snippet already sets it to DEBUG initially, but the root logger is set to INFO, so you might need to adjust that or the logger for settings_file.py).
Examine the Logs: Look at the console output or the log file generated by ebible.py. Search for messages related to the specific project IDs that are falling back to "English".
Look for the DEBUG messages added above to see if ParatextTextCorpus initialized correctly and how many verses it processed.
Look for the warnings like "No verse references found in project..." or "No valid verse data collected...". These warnings will tell you why the .vrs file generation was skipped for that project.
Look for any ERROR messages originating from the generate_vrs_from_project function.
By examining the logs with these enhanced messages, you should be able to pinpoint exactly which step is failing or returning early for the problematic projects, giving you the reason why the .vrs file isn't being created.

Can you see any errors in the settings_file.py after these changes. I'm concerned that I might have altered the indentation of some lines.

Also, what is the most common, or best-practice for setting the logging to DEBUG? Is that done in the code temporarily, or is there a python flag or some other way of altering the usual command line?

I usually run with this command-line: poetry run python ebible_code/ebible.py


Gemini
Okay, let's review the settings_file.py code with the recent logging additions and discuss logging best practices.

Review of settings_file.py Indentation:

I've reviewed the provided code for c:\ebible_code\ebible_code\settings_file.py. The indentation generally looks correct, following standard Python conventions (4 spaces).

However, I spotted a couple of the logger.debug lines that were added in the generate_vrs_from_project function that might be slightly misplaced based on typical logging intent, although their indentation within the block they are in is technically correct.

logger.debug(f"Processed {processed_verse_refs_count} verse references for {project_name}.") is inside the for text_row in corpus: loop. This will print a debug message for every single verse reference processed, which is likely excessively verbose. It's usually better to log the total count after the loop.
logger.debug(f"Collected verse data for {project_name}: {len(verse_data)} books, {sum(len(chaps) for chaps in verse_data.values())} chapters with verses.") is placed before the if not verse_data: check. It makes more sense to log the collected data after the loop finishes and before the checks that might cause early exit.
logger.debug(f" Writing VRS line: {line}") is inside the loop that writes lines to the .vrs file. This will also be extremely verbose, logging every line written. This level of detail is rarely needed and can generate massive log files.
Here is a suggested diff to adjust the placement of these debug logs for better clarity and reduced verbosity, and also remove the line-by-line writing debug log:

         logger.info(f"Successfully generated VRS file: {vrs_filepath}")
         return vrs_filepath

This diff moves the debug logs to execute once after the loop and removes the very verbose line-writing debug log. The indentation within the blocks remains correct.

Best Practice for Setting Logging to DEBUG:

Setting the logging level to DEBUG temporarily in the code (logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG, ...) or logger.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)) is the quickest way to debug a specific issue during development. However, it's generally not considered best practice for code that will be run by others or in different environments.

Here's why and what are better alternatives:

Hardcoding: Requires modifying the source code every time you want to change the logging level. Easy to forget to change back, leading to overly verbose logs in production or missing logs during debugging.
Lack of Flexibility: You can't easily change the logging level without editing the file.
Better Alternatives (Best Practices):

The most common and flexible ways to control logging levels externally are:

Environment Variables: Read an environment variable (e.g., LOG_LEVEL) at the start of your script and set the logging level based on its value.

Pros: Easy to change without touching code, works across different execution environments (command line, scripts, containers).
Cons: Requires users to know which environment variable to set.
Example:
python
import os
import logging

# Mapping from string names to logging levels
LOG_LEVELS = {
    'DEBUG': logging.DEBUG,
    'INFO': logging.INFO,
    'WARNING': logging.WARNING,
    'ERROR': logging.ERROR,
    'CRITICAL': logging.CRITICAL
}

# Get level from environment variable, default to INFO
env_level = os.getenv('LOG_LEVEL', 'INFO').upper()
log_level = LOG_LEVELS.get(env_level, logging.INFO) # Default to INFO if env var is invalid

logging.basicConfig(level=log_level, format='%(name)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s')
You would then run it like: LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG poetry run python ebible_code/ebible.py
Command-Line Arguments: Use your script's argument parser (argparse) to accept a --log-level argument.

Pros: Explicit, documented in --help, standard way to configure script behavior.
Cons: Requires modifying the argument parsing logic.
Example (in ebible.py):
python
# ... inside main() before logging setup ...
parser.add_argument(
    "--log-level",
    default="INFO", # Default level
    choices=["DEBUG", "INFO", "WARNING", "ERROR", "CRITICAL"],
    help="Set the logging level (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL)",
)
args = parser.parse_args()

# --- Setup Logging ---
log_format = '%(name)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s'
# Map the string argument to the logging constant
log_level = getattr(logging, args.log_level.upper(), logging.INFO)

logging.basicConfig(level=log_level, format=log_format)
root_logger = logging.getLogger()
root_logger.setLevel(log_level) # Set root logger level
logging.getLogger('settings_file').setLevel(log_level) # Also set specific loggers if needed
# ... rest of your code ...
You would then run it like: poetry run python ebible_code/ebible.py --log-level DEBUG
Configuration File: For complex applications, a dedicated logging configuration file (e.g., logging.conf, logging.yaml) is the most powerful approach.

Pros: Highly flexible, can configure multiple loggers, handlers (console, file, network), formatters, filters, etc.
Cons: More setup required.
Recommendation for ebible.py:

Given that ebible.py already uses argparse, adding a --log-level command-line argument is a clean and user-friendly approach. You could also combine it with an environment variable (e.g., command-line overrides environment variable) for maximum flexibility.

For temporary debugging, modifying the code is fine. For anything more permanent or for sharing, use environment variables or command-line arguments.

Let me know if you'd like a diff to add the --log-level argument to ebible.py!

I'll go with the env file method. I've added LOG_LEVEL to the .env file and set it to DEBUG. I have added the configuration at the begining of ebible.py Can you check whether I've introduced erorrs in doing these changes?


Gemini
Okay, let's take a look at the logging configuration you added to the beginning of c:\ebible_code\ebible_code\ebible.py.

Here's the relevant section from your provided code:

python
# --- CONFIGURE LOGGING before importing from settings_file ---

# Mapping from string names to logging levels
LOG_LEVELS = {
    'DEBUG': logging.DEBUG,
    'INFO': logging.INFO,
    'WARNING': logging.WARNING,
    'ERROR': logging.ERROR,
    'CRITICAL': logging.CRITICAL
}

# Get level from environment variable, default to INFO
env_level = os.getenv('LOG_LEVEL', 'INFO').upper()
log_level = LOG_LEVELS.get(env_level, logging.INFO) # Default to INFO if env var is invalid

logging.basicConfig(level=log_level, format='%(name)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s')
log_format = '%(name)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s'
root_logger = logging.getLogger() # Get root logger
root_logger.setLevel(logging.INFO) # Set minimum level to capture
root_logger.debug("Set DEBUG message level")
You've done a great job setting up the logic to read the LOG_LEVEL environment variable and map it to the correct logging constant!

However, there is one small error:

The line root_logger.setLevel(logging.INFO) directly sets the level of the root logger to INFO after you've already configured the root logger's level using logging.basicConfig(level=log_level, ...).

This means that even if your LOG_LEVEL environment variable is set to DEBUG, this line will override that setting and force the root logger's effective level back to INFO. Consequently, any DEBUG level messages (like the one immediately following it, root_logger.debug("Set DEBUG message level")) will not be displayed.

To fix this, you can simply remove the redundant root_logger.setLevel(logging.INFO) line. The logging.basicConfig call is sufficient to set the initial level for the root logger based on your log_level variable.

Here's the suggested change as a diff:

diff
-1
+0
The code change produced by Gemini could not be fully parsed. Can't automatically accept changes.
logging.basicConfig(level=log_level, format='%(name)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s')
log_format = '%(name)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s'
root_logger = logging.getLogger() # Get root logger
root_logger.setLevel(logging.INFO) # Set minimum level to capture
 root_logger.debug("Set DEBUG message level")
 
 from datetime import date, datetime, timedelta, timezone

With this change, the root logger's level will be correctly set to DEBUG when LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG is in your .env file or set in the environment, allowing you to see the more detailed debug messages from your script and imported modules (assuming their loggers are configured to propagate messages up to the root).
