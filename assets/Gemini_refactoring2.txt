The code determines a versification for each downloaded translation. It would be ideal to store this in the EBIBLE_DATA_DIR/metadata/ebible_status.csv file. the column heading would be "status_inferred_versification". The column should store the versification number not the name, to keep the file size small.


Gemini
Okay, I can help with that. We'll modify the ebible_status.py script to calculate and store the inferred versification number during the processing stage, and also update settings_file.py to facilitate this. We'll also ensure the new column is included in the Hugging Face metadata output in corpus_to_parquet.py.

Here are the necessary changes:

Modify settings_file.py: Update write_settings_file to calculate and return the versification number.
Modify ebible_status.py:
Add the new column status_inferred_versification to the list of status columns.
Update the unzip_and_process_files function to capture the versification number returned by write_settings_file and store it in the DataFrame.
Import vrs_to_num from settings_file.
Modify corpus_to_parquet.py: Add the new column to the list of metadata columns saved for Hugging Face.

Explanation:

settings_file.py:

The write_settings_file function now calculates the versification name and looks up its corresponding number using vrs_to_num.get(versification_name, float('nan')). Using .get() prevents errors if a versification name isn't found in the dictionary, defaulting to NaN (Not a Number).
It handles the case where vrs_num might be NaN before writing it to Settings.xml, defaulting to the number for "English" (4) in the XML itself, while logging a warning. This ensures the XML is valid.
The function now returns a tuple: (settings_file_path, vrs_num). The returned vrs_num can be NaN.
ebible_status.py:

status_inferred_versification is added to the STATUS_COLUMNS list. This ensures it's treated as a standard column throughout the script (initialization, loading, saving).
In unzip_and_process_files, the call to write_settings_file now unpacks the returned tuple: settings_path, vrs_num = write_settings_file(...).
The obtained vrs_num (which could be NaN) is then stored directly into the DataFrame for the current translation using df.loc[index, 'status_inferred_versification'] = vrs_num.
corpus_to_parquet.py:

status_inferred_versification is added to the relevant_metadata_columns list. This ensures that when the final metadata.csv is generated for the Hugging Face dataset, this column (containing the versification number) is included for the translations that were successfully processed into the Parquet file.
Now, when you run ebible_status.py, it will determine the versification during the processing step, store the corresponding number (or NaN if determination fails) in the ebible_status.csv, and this information will also be carried over into the metadata file generated by corpus_to_parquet.py.

In the case that no versification can be deduced we should default to "English" i.e. 4 as the versification type.


Gemini
Okay, I can help with that! We'll modify the get_versification function in settings_file.py to explicitly default to "English" when a specific versification cannot be confidently determined.

Here's the plan:

Define "English" as the default at the beginning of the function.
Handle the case where the initial corpus reading fails.
Modify the logic after the final check_vref call:
If only one versification remains, return it.
If no versifications remain (should be rare, but handle defensively), return the default with a warning.
If multiple versifications remain:
Check if "English" is among them. If yes, return "English" with a warning about the ambiguity.
If "English" is not among them, return the first remaining option (current behavior) but add a warning about the ambiguity and the choice made.

Can we add a flag to the ebible_status.py code "--update-settings". This would run the code to write the settings.xml files for each downloaded project and each private_project. It would also print the usual commands for extracting the projects. It wouldn't try to download or unzip files.


Gemini
Okay, let's add an --update-settings flag to ebible_status.py. This flag will trigger a specific mode that focuses only on regenerating the Settings.xml file for all existing project directories (both public and private) and updating the corresponding status_inferred_versification in the status file, without performing downloads or unzips.

Here's how we'll modify the script:

Add the --update-settings argument.
Create a new function update_all_settings to handle the logic when this flag is active.
Modify main() to check for the flag and call the new function if it's present, otherwise proceed with the normal workflow.

Changes Made:

argparse: Added the --update-settings flag.
update_all_settings Function:
Takes the status DataFrame, project folder paths, vrs diffs, and logfile as input.
Iterates through subdirectories in both projects_folder and private_projects_folder.
For each directory:
Treats the directory name as the translationId.
Looks up the translationId in the status DataFrame to find the languageCode.
If found and languageCode is valid, it calls write_settings_file.
Updates the status_inferred_versification in the DataFrame based on the result.
Logs warnings if the project folder isn't found in the status file or lacks a languageCode.
Returns the modified DataFrame.
main() Function:
Added a check for args.update_settings right after loading the initial status DataFrame.
If True, it calls update_all_settings, saves the result back to ebible_status.csv, prints the SILNLP commands (using a new helper function print_silnlp_commands extracted from the end of main), and exits.
If False, the script continues with the normal download/unzip/process workflow.
print_silnlp_commands Function: Extracted the logic for printing the final SILNLP commands into its own function so it can be called from both the normal workflow and the --update-settings mode.
Now you can run the script with the new flag:

bash
python ebible_code/ebible_status.py --update-settings
This will skip downloading and unzipping, iterate through your existing projects and private_projects folders, regenerate Settings.xml for each one it finds in the ebible_status.csv, update the versification number in the CSV, save the CSV, and print the extraction commands.

It would be best practice to use the same logic and code for writing the settings.xml file whether the new --update-settings argument is used, or not. Otherwise we risk have two different settings.xml files depending upon how the code was run.


Gemini
You've hit on a crucial point about code consistency! It's definitely best practice to ensure the same core logic is used regardless of the execution path.

Let's take a look at how write_settings_file is currently used in ebible_status.py:

Normal Workflow (during unzip/process): Inside the unzip_and_process_files function, after a zip file is successfully unpacked and USFM files are renamed, this line is executed:

python
# f:\GitHub\davidbaines\ebible_code\ebible_code\ebible_status.py
settings_path, vrs_num = write_settings_file(project_dir, lang_code, translation_id, vrs_diffs_data)
--update-settings Workflow: Inside the update_all_settings function, while iterating through existing project directories, this line is executed:

python
# f:\GitHub\davidbaines\ebible_code\ebible_code\ebible_status.py
settings_path, vrs_num = write_settings_file(project_dir, lang_code, translation_id, vrs_diffs_data)
As you can see, both workflows call the exact same function (write_settings_file from settings_file.py) with the same set of parameters derived from the project directory (project_dir), the language code (lang_code), the translation ID (translation_id), and the versification differences data (vrs_diffs_data).

So, the good news is that the current structure already follows the best practice you suggested! The logic for generating the Settings.xml content and determining the versification is centralized within write_settings_file, ensuring consistency whether you're processing a newly unzipped project or explicitly updating settings for existing ones. You shouldn't risk getting different Settings.xml files based solely on which execution path (--update-settings or normal) is taken.

That is good news. I've been trying to simplify some of the settings_file.py and might have introduced errors. Maybe it was longer standing error. However at the moment it is defaulting to English for every project. Can you help by checking the logic and seeing whether there are faults or improvements that would make it work as expected?


Gemini
Okay, let's dive into the settings_file.py logic, particularly get_versification and its helper functions, to see why it might be defaulting to "English" too often.

You've hit on a likely culprit: the interaction between get_corpus, write_temp_settings_file, and the actual filenames being processed.

Here's the breakdown:

get_corpus: This function creates a temporary environment (vrs_path) to analyze only the books relevant for versification differences. It copies the renamed .SFM files (e.g., 01GENeng.SFM, 40MATeng.SFM) into this temporary folder.
write_temp_settings_file: This function then writes a Settings.xml file into that same temporary folder. The machine.corpora.ParatextTextCorpus relies heavily on this settings file to know how to find and interpret the text files.
The Mismatch: The crucial issue lies in the Naming element generated by write_temp_settings_file. It currently writes:

This tells ParatextTextCorpus to look for files named like 46-MAT{project_name}.usfm, 47-MRK{project_name}.usfm, etc. However, the files actually present in the temporary folder (copied by get_corpus and previously renamed by rename_usfm.py) are named like 01GENeng.SFM, 40MATeng.SFM, etc. Because the Naming pattern doesn't match the actual files, ParatextTextCorpus likely finds no texts, extract_scripture_corpus returns an empty list (lines), and get_versification immediately hits the IndexError exception handler, causing it to return the default_versification ("English").
Solution:

We need to make write_temp_settings_file generate a Naming element that accurately describes the .SFM files created by rename_usfm.py.

Modify write_temp_settings_file to accept the language_code.
Update the Naming element within write_temp_settings_file to use BookNameForm="01MAT{language_code}" and PostPart=".SFM".
Update get_corpus to accept and pass the language_code to write_temp_settings_file.
Update the call to get_corpus within get_versification to pass the language_code.
Update the call to get_versification within write_settings_file to pass the language_code.

Explanation of Changes:

write_temp_settings_file:
Added language_code: str as a parameter.
Changed the Naming element to BookNameForm="01MAT{language_code}" and PostPart=".SFM". This pattern should now correctly match the files like 01GENeng.SFM that ParatextTextCorpus needs to find.
get_corpus:
Added language_code: str as a parameter.
Passed the received language_code when calling write_temp_settings_file(vrs_path, language_code).
Updated the return type hint slightly to list[tuple[str, VerseRef, VerseRef | None]] as extract_scripture_corpus can yield None for the target ref.
get_versification:
Added language_code: str as a parameter.
Passed the received language_code when calling get_corpus(project_folder, vrs_diffs, language_code).
write_settings_file:
Passed the existing language_code parameter when calling get_versification(project_folder, vrs_diffs, language_code).
With these changes, the temporary Settings.xml created during versification detection should correctly point ParatextTextCorpus to the .SFM files, allowing extract_scripture_corpus to read the verses. This should resolve the issue of get_corpus returning an empty list and prevent the function from always defaulting to "English" due to the IndexError.

Give this a try, and hopefully, the versification detection will work as expected now!

There was an attempt to avoid the need to copy files and write temp files. You'll see that in the comments. Could you review that commented out code and see whether that can be used in the place of this solution? It should be more performant, hopefully it would avoid the possibility of different temp vs permanent Settings.xml files.


Gemini
Okay, let's look at that commented-out code. It represents an alternative approach to get_versification that aims to read the USFM files directly, line by line, instead of creating a temporary corpus structure. This should indeed be more performant by avoiding file copying and temporary directory creation/deletion.

The core idea is sound:

Identify the relevant .SFM files using get_book_names.
Iterate through the books known to have versification differences (vrs_diffs).
If a corresponding .SFM file exists, stream its content line by line using stream_verse_refs_from_file.
This new helper function stream_verse_refs_from_file uses regex to find chapter (\c) and verse (\v) markers and yields VerseRef objects.
The main loop then compares the current VerseRef (vref) with the previous one (prev_vref) and calls check_vref when the chapter changes, just like the current implementation does with the corpus data.
To make this work, we need to:

Uncomment the alternative get_versification and the stream_verse_refs_from_file function.
Import necessary modules (codecs, Iterator, VerseRef, Versification).
Address the FHS placeholder in stream_verse_refs_from_file. We need a default Versification object to parse the verse strings. Using the "English" versification for this parsing step is reasonable, as check_vref primarily relies on the numeric book/chapter/verse values, which are correctly extracted regardless of the parsing system used, as long as the basic BOOK C:V format is understood.
Remove the now-redundant get_corpus and write_temp_settings_file functions.
Update write_settings_file to call the new get_versification (the signature is the same, so no change needed there).
This approach avoids the temporary files and the potential inconsistency between temporary and final Settings.xml files because no temporary settings file is needed for versification detection anymore.

Many of the updated Settings.xml files now contain the line " <Versification>None</Versification>" The code should make this impossible. 'None' isn't a valid versification and 4 needs to be the default and fallback value.

I think that the next steps would be to dig into that get_versification code and find a way to debug it.

One way that I think could be helpful is create a reporting csv file. The translationid would be the key in the first column, the path to the Settings.xml file in the second column. The old and new values would then be stored in columns named: old_Versification old_LanguageIsoCode old_BookNameForm old_PostPart old_PrePart new_Versification new_LanguageIsoCode new_BookNameForm new_PostPart new_PrePart

This could be writen out to the ebible_data/metadata/ folder as settings_update.csv

Okay, that's a good debugging strategy! Seeing the before-and-after state of the Settings.xml values will definitely help pinpoint where things might be going wrong with the versification detection or the writing process.

Let's modify settings_file.py and ebible_status.py to implement this reporting.

1. Modify settings_file.py (write_settings_file)

We'll enhance write_settings_file to:

Read the existing Settings.xml if it exists.
Parse the old values using xml.etree.ElementTree.
Calculate the new values, ensuring vrs_num defaults robustly to 4.
Return both old and new values.

Explanation:

settings_file.py:
Imports xml.etree.ElementTree.
write_settings_file now tries to parse the existing Settings.xml before overwriting it. It stores the found values (or None) in old_settings.
It calculates the new vrs_num, explicitly defaulting to 4 if get_versification fails or returns an unexpected value.
It stores the calculated new values in new_settings.
It writes the Settings.xml using the values from new_settings.
It returns the path, the final vrs_num, old_settings, and new_settings.
ebible_status.py:
In update_all_settings, a list settings_report_data is created.
The call to write_settings_file now unpacks all four return values.
If writing was successful, a dictionary combining the translationId, path, old_vals, and new_vals is appended to settings_report_data.
After iterating through all projects, if settings_report_data is not empty, it's converted to a DataFrame and saved as settings_update.csv in the metadata folder.
The call in unzip_and_process_files is updated just to handle the changed return signature of write_settings_file.
Now, when you run with --update-settings, it will not only update the Settings.xml files (robustly defaulting versification to 4) and the status CSV but also generate metadata/settings_update.csv detailing the changes made (or attempted) for each settings file. This should give you much better visibility into the process.

This is great. The settings_update.csv shows that all the versifications were updated from None to 1. That's an improvement since None wasn't valid. However it shows that the get_versification code isn't working properly since it never chooses anything other than 1

Can you advise how to debug this further?


Gemini
Okay, it seems like the versification detection logic in get_versification is still not quite right if it's consistently landing on 1 ("Septuagint"). Getting 1 instead of None is better, but not correct if it's happening for everything.

The most likely reasons are:

The check_vref function might be eliminating correct versifications too aggressively, leaving only "Septuagint" (which might be the first in the list).
The stream_verse_refs_from_file function might not be yielding enough distinct verse references for check_vref to effectively differentiate.
There might be an issue with how the loop in get_versification processes the references or calls check_vref.
Debugging Strategy: Add Detailed Logging

The best way to debug this further is to add print statements (or proper logging) inside the key functions (get_versification, stream_verse_refs_from_file, and check_vref) to trace the execution flow and see exactly what data is being processed and how decisions are being made.

Let's add some print statements. We'll focus on get_versification and check_vref first, as the issue likely lies in the decision-making process.

How to Use This:

Apply the diff above to your settings_file.py.
Run the ebible_status.py --update-settings command again.
Examine the console output (or redirect it to a file: python ebible_code/ebible_status.py --update-settings > debug_log.txt).
What to Look For in the Output:

Project Identification: Make sure the correct project folder is being processed (--- get_versification for: [project_name] ---).
Initial List: Check the starting list of versifications. It should include all known types.
Chapter/Book Changes: See where check_vref is being triggered (-> Chapter/Book change detected...).
check_vref Actions: Pay close attention to the lines starting check_vref: Ruling out... or check_vref: Keeping.... This tells you why a specific versification is being kept or discarded based on the verse being checked (prev_vref).
List Reduction: Observe how the list printed after Finished book... shrinks (or doesn't). Is it always shrinking to just ['Septuagint'] very quickly?
Final Check: See what prev_vref is used for the final check and what the result is.
Ambiguity/Defaulting: Check the final messages to see if it's hitting one of the ambiguity or default conditions.
This detailed trace should help you identify if check_vref has a logic bug, if certain verses are causing unexpected eliminations, or if the loop isn't processing enough data before making a decision. If the logs show very few calls to check_vref, you might need to add logging to stream_verse_refs_from_file as well.

I wasn't able to accept the changes automatically . I think I had unsaved changes in settings_file.py

Ah, that can happen! When you have local, unsaved changes, tools often can't automatically apply incoming changes to avoid overwriting your work.

No problem, here is the diff again with the debugging print statements for get_versification and check_vref in settings_file.py. You can use this to manually add the logging or resolve the conflicts with your existing changes.

This should help you get the logging in place to see why the versification detection might be defaulting incorrectly.
