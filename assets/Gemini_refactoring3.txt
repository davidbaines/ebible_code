In this repo the @ebible_status.py has the main aim of downloading, unzipping bibles from ebible.org. The Bibles are described by translations.csv from ebible.org. The code adds licence_* data and status_* data to a copy of the translations.csv and stores that metadata in the EBIBLE_DATA_DIR/metadata/ebible_status.csv. 
The downloaded files are zipped folders which contain one usfm file per book of the Bible. The files are renamed <book_num><book_id><language_code>.SFM and a Settings.xml file is written to the folder for each Bible. Then external code from the SILNLP repo is run to extract the Bibles into a one-verse-per-line format. This creates a parallel corpus ready for machine learning tasks.
