I would like to modify the get versification code so that it is more heuristic and therefore more robust. Versifications are more like guidelines or traditions than rules. Few Bibles actually follow a given Versification system perfectly. It's more the case that a versification can be written from any Bible and there are some well-known Bibles whose versification has been used by other translators.

There are specifications for each. For example the @vul.vrs I've placed one of these vrs file for each versification, in the assets folder. Lines begining with # are comments. Some of the comments provide very useful information for understanding which books should be present. The code isn't expected to read those, of course, but they may be useful to help a human make a decicion about which versification to use. Lines begining with a bookid list the number of verses in each chapter. This is the main data the script would need to parse and use. Some vrs files may not specify all books. That would be a major clue that if the book is present in the Bible it probably isn't using a versification that omits that book. Some Bibles will have chapters that are not present in a given versification, again that would be a clue that that Bible isn't following that versification. We have to take into account the fact that many of the Bibles are not fully translated yet - so missing books are more likely because they are not yet translated.

We could count the number of verses in each Bible. Then count how many of the Books, Chapters and Verses present are also present in each Versification. For the chapters that exist in the Bible we could count how many have exactly the correct number of verses as defined by each versification. For Books that exist in the Bible we can check whether those books are also in each versification. All these could then be combined in some way to give a score, for how similar the Bible is to each versification.

Are there other things I'd need to consider here? Is any clarification required?

Here is a sample of the vul.vrs file.

Okay, this sounds like a fascinating and practical challenge! Building a heuristic to suggest the most likely versification system for a given Bible text, especially considering incomplete translations, is a great goal. Your proposed approach of comparing book/chapter presence and verse counts is a solid foundation.

Let's break down the factors and potential additions:

Core Comparison Points (As you suggested):

Book Presence:
Bible Books vs. Versification Books: Check which books present in the Bible are also defined in the .vrs file. A high overlap is a positive signal.
Versification Books vs. Bible Books: Check if the .vrs file defines books not found in the Bible. This is a weaker negative signal due to incomplete translations, but significant omissions (like a .vrs defining deuterocanonical books when the Bible clearly has none) can be informative.
Chapter Presence (within shared books):
For books found in both the Bible and the .vrs file, check which chapters present in the Bible are also defined in the .vrs file for that book.
Again, check if the .vrs defines chapters not present in the Bible for a shared book. This is also a weak signal due to partial work.
Verse Count Matching (within shared chapters):
This is likely your strongest signal. For chapters found in both the Bible and the .vrs file, compare the maximum verse number. Count how many chapters have an exact match.
Developing the Scoring Heuristic:

Weighting: You'll need to assign weights to the comparison points. Intuitively:
Verse Count Matching should have the highest weight.
Book Presence should have a significant weight (especially regarding canonical differences like Apocrypha/Deuterocanon).
Chapter Presence might have the lowest weight, as it's most susceptible to being skewed by incomplete work.
Normalization: To compare scores across different .vrs files fairly, you need normalization. A good approach might be to base the score on the content present in the Bible being analyzed:
Book Score: (Number of Bible books also in .vrs) / (Total number of books in Bible)
Chapter Score: (Number of Bible chapters also in .vrs for shared books) / (Total number of Bible chapters in shared books)
Verse Count Score: (Number of shared chapters with matching verse counts) / (Total number of shared chapters)
Combined Score: (W1 * Book Score) + (W2 * Chapter Score) + (W3 * Verse Count Score)
This focuses on how well a versification explains the data you have, mitigating the impact of missing (potentially untranslated) data.
Other Things to Consider:

Verse Mappings (= lines): The .vrs files contain explicit verse mapping information (e.g., EXO 8:1-4 = EXO 7:26-29). This defines precise differences like verse splits, merges, or renumberings between the versification described and a reference standard (often BHS/GNT/LXX).
Potential: If you could parse these mapping rules and check if the specific verse numbers at these known difference points in your Bible text match the .vrs definition, it would be a very powerful heuristic signal, much stronger than just max verse counts. For example, does the Bible text have content at EXO 7:26-29 or EXO 8:1-4? Matching the .vrs side of the equation (EXO 8:1-4 in this case for Vulgate) would strongly indicate that versification.
Complexity: This significantly increases parsing complexity. You'd need to handle ranges, potential one-to-many or many-to-one mappings, and access specific verse content/presence in the Bible data, not just chapter counts.
Handling Incompleteness: Your normalization approach helps, but be mindful: a Bible with only Genesis translated might perfectly match the Genesis entry in multiple .vrs files. The heuristic will be more reliable as more of the Bible is present. Perhaps add a "confidence" metric based on the amount of Bible text analyzed.
Canonical Differences: The presence or absence of Deuterocanonical/Apocryphal books (like Tobit, Judith, Wisdom, Sirach, Baruch, 1/2 Maccabees in the Vulgate .vrs) is a major clue. Your Book Presence check should heavily factor this in. Some .vrs files might explicitly exclude them.
Specific Book Variations: Note the comments in vul.vrs about Esther (Hebrew vs. Greek length/chapters) and Daniel (inclusion of additions like Susanna, Bel and the Dragon). If your Bible data includes chapter/verse counts for these specific variations, it can help distinguish between .vrs files (e.g., DAN 3:100 vs DAN 3:33).
Verse Subdivisions: The .vrs sometimes implies subdivisions (e.g., EST 3:15 in NVL98 having 15a-i). Your current plan uses the max verse number (15). If your Bible data could distinguish between EST 3:15 and EST 3:15i, you could potentially refine the Verse Count Matching, but this is likely an edge case and adds complexity.
Multiple Matches: Don't expect a single perfect score. It's more likely you'll get a ranked list (e.g., "Vulgate: 85%, KJV: 60%, LXX: 45%"). Presenting the top few matches is probably the best output.
Data Source: How will you get the book/chapter/verse counts from the Bible text? Is it parsed from USFM, queried from a database, etc.? This affects implementation. Ensure consistent Book ID usage (the .vrs uses 3-letter codes).
Clarification Required:

Is the added complexity of parsing and comparing the specific verse mappings (= lines) desirable and feasible given your Bible data access, or should the focus remain on the simpler book/chapter presence and max verse counts?
How is the Bible data (book list, chapter list per book, verse count per chapter) being obtained?
Your initial plan is a great start, and focusing on the three main comparison points with careful weighting and normalization will likely yield good results. Adding the verse mapping check would be the next level of sophistication if feasible.

The Book, Chapter and verse list need to be obtained by parsing the *.SFM files in each Bible project folder. Only the \id \c and \v markers need to be parsed. \v markers without text, if they exist are a good indication that the translator intends to translate that number of verses in that chapter. When we look at the specific verse mappings we have to be careful how they are interpeted. in the example given: EXO 8:1-4 = EXO 7:26-29 both a Bible following the Vulgate vrs and one following all the others are expected to contain verses 8:4-1 since there more than 8 chapters. We can't tell if the meaning of the translation in verses 8:1-4 is the same. However if we found that in the Vulgate EXO chapter 7 is shorter because those verses have been moved to the begining of chapter 8, and we find that chapter 8 is longer that's a good indication. This information should however already be represented in the EXO line. Therefore let's not try to make use of those specific verse mappings. Let's begin with a Book Score weight of 2, a chapter score weight of 1 and a verse count score weight of 2.5. We can test and iterate with those later. The Bible SFM files can contain letter divisions of the verses following the pattern \v \d{1,3}[a-zA-Z] though other wordforming charaters may be used in other scripts. If there is more than one letter following it should be considered an error. That is most likely a missing space before the first word of the verse. I think there are few examples of these subdivided verses and we should simply count those as one verse. (Let's add code to note which Bibles have these somewhere in them - that wiil be a guide to how important they might be.)

We could start by producing and testing a script that will parse the SFM files and list the Books, Chapters, and verses in each. This information could potentially be added to the ebible_status.csv file for each file. Or stored as a per-project csv file in the project folder. That might be better to begin with and can be revisited later. Is this a good way forward?

Okay, that sounds like a very sensible and pragmatic approach!

Yes, starting by creating a script to parse the SFM files and extract the structural information (Book ID, Chapter Number, Max Verse Number per Chapter) is an excellent way forward.

Here's why this is a good plan:

Modular Development: It breaks the larger problem down into a manageable, distinct task. You can focus solely on correctly interpreting the SFM structure first.
Creates Necessary Input: The output of this script (the structural data for a Bible) is the essential input needed for the next step – comparing against the .vrs files.
Testable Unit: You can easily test this SFM parsing script against various Bible projects to ensure it correctly handles different SFM files, including those with empty verse markers or verse subdivisions, before worrying about the comparison logic.
Intermediate Data: Storing this parsed structure in a per-project CSV file is a great idea. It provides:
A snapshot of the Bible's structure for review.
A persistent data source, so you don't need to re-parse the SFM files every time you want to run the versification comparison (unless the Bible files change).
A clear separation between data extraction and data analysis (the heuristic scoring).
Regarding your specific points:

SFM Parsing (\id, \c, \v): This is the correct focus. You need the book identifier, the start of each chapter, and the verse markers within each chapter.
Empty \v Markers: Counting these is crucial, as they represent the intended structure, even if text isn't present yet. Your parser should find the highest verse number mentioned (or implied by an empty marker) within each chapter.
Verse Subdivisions (\v 1a, etc.): Your plan to treat \v 1a, \v 1b, etc., as contributing only to the count for verse 1 (i.e., finding the maximum numeric verse part) is standard practice and avoids unnecessary complexity at this stage. Logging occurrences of these subdivisions (\v \d+[a-zA-Z]) is a good secondary goal to understand their prevalence. You'll need a regular expression to capture the number and the optional letter separately.
Excluding = Mappings: Agree completely. While potentially useful for fine-grained analysis, the chapter/verse counts derived from the main book lines in the .vrs file capture the most significant structural differences. Ignoring the = lines simplifies the initial implementation considerably.
Weighting: The proposed weights (Book: 2, Chapter: 1, Verse Count: 2.5) are a reasonable starting point. Verse count matching is often the strongest indicator, so giving it the highest weight makes sense. These can definitely be tuned later based on testing.
Output CSV: A simple Book,Chapter,MaxVerse CSV file per project is perfect for the initial output.
Next Steps Outline:

Develop the SFM Parser:
Function to find all .SFM (or .sfm, case-insensitive) files in a given project directory.
Logic to iterate through lines of each file.
State variables to keep track of the current book_id and chapter_num.
A data structure (like a dictionary nested within a dictionary: results[book_id][chapter_num] = max_verse) to store the maximum verse number found for each chapter.
A list or set to store detected verse subdivisions (book_id chapter:verse_subdivision).
Regular expressions to identify and extract data from \id, \c, and \v markers. The \v regex should capture the number and the optional single letter separately.
Update the max_verse for the current chapter whenever a \v marker with a higher numeric part is encountered.
Handle potential errors gracefully (e.g., a \v marker before a \c).
Write Output:
After processing all files for a project, write the contents of the results data structure to a CSV file (e.g., _versification_data.csv) within that project's folder.
Optionally, print or write the log of verse subdivisions found.
Test: Run the parser on a few different Bible projects (ideally ones you suspect use different versifications) and manually check the output CSVs for accuracy.
Once you have this SFM parser working reliably, you'll be in a great position to tackle the next phase: parsing the .vrs files and implementing the scoring heuristic.

Would you write a new script to do this parsing? Please avoid the os module in preference for the pathlib path module. Let's call the output .csv verse_counts_<translation_id>.csv and put it in the project's own folder - the same one that contains the SFM files. Is csv the best output format?

How to Use:

Save the code above as a Python file (e.g., parse_sfm_verse_counts.py).
Open your terminal or command prompt.
Run the script, providing the path to the project folder as an argument:
bash
python parse_sfm_verse_counts.py /path/to/your/bible/project_folder
(Replace /path/to/your/bible/project_folder with the actual path).
The script will:
Print progress messages to the console.
Create a CSV file named verse_counts_<folder_name>.csv inside the specified project folder.
Print a list of any detected verse subdivisions (like GEN 1:1a) to the console.
Is CSV the best output format?

For this specific purpose, yes, CSV is likely the best format.

Simplicity: The structure (Book, Chapter, MaxVerse) is inherently tabular, making CSV a natural fit.
Readability: It's easily human-readable and editable with basic text editors.
Interoperability: Virtually all spreadsheet programs (Excel, Google Sheets, LibreOffice Calc) and data analysis tools can import CSV files effortlessly.
Goal Alignment: You mentioned potentially adding this data to ebible_status.csv later. Having it already in CSV makes that integration simpler.
Lightweight: It's a very storage-efficient format for this kind of data.
While JSON could represent the nested structure ({book: {chapter: verse}}) more directly, it adds slight overhead for reading/writing and might be less convenient for quick inspection in a spreadsheet, which seems like a common use case here. YAML is even more human-readable but less standard for pure data exchange.

Given the straightforward, tabular nature of the desired output and the likely downstream uses (manual review, spreadsheet import, potential merging with other CSVs), CSV is a pragmatic and effective choice.

I have put @paratext.py in the ebible_code folder. That contains functions for parsing SFM files. It is copied from the SILNLP repo so the environments will need to be modified. However there are probably some useful functions in that script that mean this one doesn't have to parse the SFM itself but can rely on those functions.

Okay, that's a good idea! Using existing, robust parsing functions from paratext.py (presumably based on SIL's machine.corpora or similar) can definitely make the count_verses.py script cleaner and potentially more reliable than relying solely on basic regex line parsing.

Assuming paratext.py provides access to something like machine.corpora.ParatextTextCorpus, we can refactor parse_project_verse_counts to use it. This corpus class typically handles the complexities of SFM parsing internally and allows iteration over verses.

Here's how we can modify count_verses.py:

Refactoring Steps:

Import: Add the necessary import from machine.corpora (assuming paratext.py makes this available or uses it internally).
Replace Parsing Logic: Modify parse_project_verse_counts to instantiate ParatextTextCorpus and iterate through its verses instead of reading files line by line.
Extract Verse Info: Get the book, chapter, and verse number (handling subdivisions) from the objects yielded by the corpus.
Maintain Functionality: Ensure the subdivision logging and output generation remain the same.
Potential Considerations:

Dependencies: This change introduces a dependency on the library providing ParatextTextCorpus (likely machine or silnlp). Ensure your environment is set up correctly.
Error Handling: Add error handling around the corpus instantiation and iteration, as ParatextTextCorpus might raise exceptions for malformed SFM or missing files.
Performance: For very large projects, initializing the full corpus might have different performance characteristics than the line-by-line regex approach. However, for correctness and robustness, using the dedicated corpus class is generally preferred.
Verse String Format: The exact way verse numbers (especially with subdivisions like '1a') are represented by ParatextTextCorpus might vary. We'll adapt the parsing of the verse number accordingly.
Let's apply these changes.

I would like to modify the get versification code so that it is more heuristic and therefore more robust. Versifications are more like guidelines or traditions than rules. Few Bibles actually follow a given Versification system perfectly. It's more the case that a versification can be written from any Bible and there are some well-known Bibles whose versification has been used by other translators.

There are specifications for each. For example the @vul.vrs I've placed one of these vrs file for each versification, in the assets folder. Lines begining with # are comments. Some of the comments provide very useful information for understanding which books should be present. The code isn't expected to read those, of course, but they may be useful to help a human make a decicion about which versification to use. Lines begining with a bookid list the number of verses in each chapter. This is the main data the script would need to parse and use. Some vrs files may not specify all books. That would be a major clue that if the book is present in the Bible it probably isn't using a versification that omits that book. Some Bibles will have chapters that are not present in a given versification, again that would be a clue that that Bible isn't following that versification. We have to take into account the fact that many of the Bibles are not fully translated yet - so missing books are more likely because they are not yet translated.

We could count the number of verses in each Bible. Then count how many of the Books, Chapters and Verses present are also present in each Versification. For the chapters that exist in the Bible we could count how many have exactly the correct number of verses as defined by each versification. For Books that exist in the Bible we can check whether those books are also in each versification. All these could then be combined in some way to give a score, for how similar the Bible is to each versification.

Are there other things I'd need to consider here? Is any clarification required?

Here is a sample of the vul.vrs file.

Okay, this sounds like a fascinating and practical challenge! Building a heuristic to suggest the most likely versification system for a given Bible text, especially considering incomplete translations, is a great goal. Your proposed approach of comparing book/chapter presence and verse counts is a solid foundation.

Let's break down the factors and potential additions:

Core Comparison Points (As you suggested):

Book Presence:
Bible Books vs. Versification Books: Check which books present in the Bible are also defined in the .vrs file. A high overlap is a positive signal.
Versification Books vs. Bible Books: Check if the .vrs file defines books not found in the Bible. This is a weaker negative signal due to incomplete translations, but significant omissions (like a .vrs defining deuterocanonical books when the Bible clearly has none) can be informative.
Chapter Presence (within shared books):
For books found in both the Bible and the .vrs file, check which chapters present in the Bible are also defined in the .vrs file for that book.
Again, check if the .vrs defines chapters not present in the Bible for a shared book. This is also a weak signal due to partial work.
Verse Count Matching (within shared chapters):
This is likely your strongest signal. For chapters found in both the Bible and the .vrs file, compare the maximum verse number. Count how many chapters have an exact match.
Developing the Scoring Heuristic:

Weighting: You'll need to assign weights to the comparison points. Intuitively:
Verse Count Matching should have the highest weight.
Book Presence should have a significant weight (especially regarding canonical differences like Apocrypha/Deuterocanon).
Chapter Presence might have the lowest weight, as it's most susceptible to being skewed by incomplete work.
Normalization: To compare scores across different .vrs files fairly, you need normalization. A good approach might be to base the score on the content present in the Bible being analyzed:
Book Score: (Number of Bible books also in .vrs) / (Total number of books in Bible)
Chapter Score: (Number of Bible chapters also in .vrs for shared books) / (Total number of Bible chapters in shared books)
Verse Count Score: (Number of shared chapters with matching verse counts) / (Total number of shared chapters)
Combined Score: (W1 * Book Score) + (W2 * Chapter Score) + (W3 * Verse Count Score)
This focuses on how well a versification explains the data you have, mitigating the impact of missing (potentially untranslated) data.
Other Things to Consider:

Verse Mappings (= lines): The .vrs files contain explicit verse mapping information (e.g., EXO 8:1-4 = EXO 7:26-29). This defines precise differences like verse splits, merges, or renumberings between the versification described and a reference standard (often BHS/GNT/LXX).
Potential: If you could parse these mapping rules and check if the specific verse numbers at these known difference points in your Bible text match the .vrs definition, it would be a very powerful heuristic signal, much stronger than just max verse counts. For example, does the Bible text have content at EXO 7:26-29 or EXO 8:1-4? Matching the .vrs side of the equation (EXO 8:1-4 in this case for Vulgate) would strongly indicate that versification.
Complexity: This significantly increases parsing complexity. You'd need to handle ranges, potential one-to-many or many-to-one mappings, and access specific verse content/presence in the Bible data, not just chapter counts.
Handling Incompleteness: Your normalization approach helps, but be mindful: a Bible with only Genesis translated might perfectly match the Genesis entry in multiple .vrs files. The heuristic will be more reliable as more of the Bible is present. Perhaps add a "confidence" metric based on the amount of Bible text analyzed.
Canonical Differences: The presence or absence of Deuterocanonical/Apocryphal books (like Tobit, Judith, Wisdom, Sirach, Baruch, 1/2 Maccabees in the Vulgate .vrs) is a major clue. Your Book Presence check should heavily factor this in. Some .vrs files might explicitly exclude them.
Specific Book Variations: Note the comments in vul.vrs about Esther (Hebrew vs. Greek length/chapters) and Daniel (inclusion of additions like Susanna, Bel and the Dragon). If your Bible data includes chapter/verse counts for these specific variations, it can help distinguish between .vrs files (e.g., DAN 3:100 vs DAN 3:33).
Verse Subdivisions: The .vrs sometimes implies subdivisions (e.g., EST 3:15 in NVL98 having 15a-i). Your current plan uses the max verse number (15). If your Bible data could distinguish between EST 3:15 and EST 3:15i, you could potentially refine the Verse Count Matching, but this is likely an edge case and adds complexity.
Multiple Matches: Don't expect a single perfect score. It's more likely you'll get a ranked list (e.g., "Vulgate: 85%, KJV: 60%, LXX: 45%"). Presenting the top few matches is probably the best output.
Data Source: How will you get the book/chapter/verse counts from the Bible text? Is it parsed from USFM, queried from a database, etc.? This affects implementation. Ensure consistent Book ID usage (the .vrs uses 3-letter codes).
Clarification Required:

Is the added complexity of parsing and comparing the specific verse mappings (= lines) desirable and feasible given your Bible data access, or should the focus remain on the simpler book/chapter presence and max verse counts?
How is the Bible data (book list, chapter list per book, verse count per chapter) being obtained?
Your initial plan is a great start, and focusing on the three main comparison points with careful weighting and normalization will likely yield good results. Adding the verse mapping check would be the next level of sophistication if feasible.

The Book, Chapter and verse list need to be obtained by parsing the *.SFM files in each Bible project folder. Only the \id \c and \v markers need to be parsed. \v markers without text, if they exist are a good indication that the translator intends to translate that number of verses in that chapter. When we look at the specific verse mappings we have to be careful how they are interpeted. in the example given: EXO 8:1-4 = EXO 7:26-29 both a Bible following the Vulgate vrs and one following all the others are expected to contain verses 8:4-1 since there more than 8 chapters. We can't tell if the meaning of the translation in verses 8:1-4 is the same. However if we found that in the Vulgate EXO chapter 7 is shorter because those verses have been moved to the begining of chapter 8, and we find that chapter 8 is longer that's a good indication. This information should however already be represented in the EXO line. Therefore let's not try to make use of those specific verse mappings. Let's begin with a Book Score weight of 2, a chapter score weight of 1 and a verse count score weight of 2.5. We can test and iterate with those later. The Bible SFM files can contain letter divisions of the verses following the pattern \v \d{1,3}[a-zA-Z] though other wordforming charaters may be used in other scripts. If there is more than one letter following it should be considered an error. That is most likely a missing space before the first word of the verse. I think there are few examples of these subdivided verses and we should simply count those as one verse. (Let's add code to note which Bibles have these somewhere in them - that wiil be a guide to how important they might be.)

We could start by producing and testing a script that will parse the SFM files and list the Books, Chapters, and verses in each. This information could potentially be added to the ebible_status.csv file for each file. Or stored as a per-project csv file in the project folder. That might be better to begin with and can be revisited later. Is this a good way forward?

Okay, that sounds like a very sensible and pragmatic approach!

Yes, starting by creating a script to parse the SFM files and extract the structural information (Book ID, Chapter Number, Max Verse Number per Chapter) is an excellent way forward.

Here's why this is a good plan:

Modular Development: It breaks the larger problem down into a manageable, distinct task. You can focus solely on correctly interpreting the SFM structure first.
Creates Necessary Input: The output of this script (the structural data for a Bible) is the essential input needed for the next step – comparing against the .vrs files.
Testable Unit: You can easily test this SFM parsing script against various Bible projects to ensure it correctly handles different SFM files, including those with empty verse markers or verse subdivisions, before worrying about the comparison logic.
Intermediate Data: Storing this parsed structure in a per-project CSV file is a great idea. It provides:
A snapshot of the Bible's structure for review.
A persistent data source, so you don't need to re-parse the SFM files every time you want to run the versification comparison (unless the Bible files change).
A clear separation between data extraction and data analysis (the heuristic scoring).
Regarding your specific points:

SFM Parsing (\id, \c, \v): This is the correct focus. You need the book identifier, the start of each chapter, and the verse markers within each chapter.
Empty \v Markers: Counting these is crucial, as they represent the intended structure, even if text isn't present yet. Your parser should find the highest verse number mentioned (or implied by an empty marker) within each chapter.
Verse Subdivisions (\v 1a, etc.): Your plan to treat \v 1a, \v 1b, etc., as contributing only to the count for verse 1 (i.e., finding the maximum numeric verse part) is standard practice and avoids unnecessary complexity at this stage. Logging occurrences of these subdivisions (\v \d+[a-zA-Z]) is a good secondary goal to understand their prevalence. You'll need a regular expression to capture the number and the optional letter separately.
Excluding = Mappings: Agree completely. While potentially useful for fine-grained analysis, the chapter/verse counts derived from the main book lines in the .vrs file capture the most significant structural differences. Ignoring the = lines simplifies the initial implementation considerably.
Weighting: The proposed weights (Book: 2, Chapter: 1, Verse Count: 2.5) are a reasonable starting point. Verse count matching is often the strongest indicator, so giving it the highest weight makes sense. These can definitely be tuned later based on testing.
Output CSV: A simple Book,Chapter,MaxVerse CSV file per project is perfect for the initial output.
Next Steps Outline:

Develop the SFM Parser:
Function to find all .SFM (or .sfm, case-insensitive) files in a given project directory.
Logic to iterate through lines of each file.
State variables to keep track of the current book_id and chapter_num.
A data structure (like a dictionary nested within a dictionary: results[book_id][chapter_num] = max_verse) to store the maximum verse number found for each chapter.
A list or set to store detected verse subdivisions (book_id chapter:verse_subdivision).
Regular expressions to identify and extract data from \id, \c, and \v markers. The \v regex should capture the number and the optional single letter separately.
Update the max_verse for the current chapter whenever a \v marker with a higher numeric part is encountered.
Handle potential errors gracefully (e.g., a \v marker before a \c).
Write Output:
After processing all files for a project, write the contents of the results data structure to a CSV file (e.g., _versification_data.csv) within that project's folder.
Optionally, print or write the log of verse subdivisions found.
Test: Run the parser on a few different Bible projects (ideally ones you suspect use different versifications) and manually check the output CSVs for accuracy.
Once you have this SFM parser working reliably, you'll be in a great position to tackle the next phase: parsing the .vrs files and implementing the scoring heuristic.

Would you write a new script to do this parsing? Please avoid the os module in preference for the pathlib path module. Let's call the output .csv verse_counts_<translation_id>.csv and put it in the project's own folder - the same one that contains the SFM files. Is csv the best output format?

How to Use:

Save the code above as a Python file (e.g., parse_sfm_verse_counts.py).
Open your terminal or command prompt.
Run the script, providing the path to the project folder as an argument:
bash
python parse_sfm_verse_counts.py /path/to/your/bible/project_folder
(Replace /path/to/your/bible/project_folder with the actual path).
The script will:
Print progress messages to the console.
Create a CSV file named verse_counts_<folder_name>.csv inside the specified project folder.
Print a list of any detected verse subdivisions (like GEN 1:1a) to the console.
Is CSV the best output format?

For this specific purpose, yes, CSV is likely the best format.

Simplicity: The structure (Book, Chapter, MaxVerse) is inherently tabular, making CSV a natural fit.
Readability: It's easily human-readable and editable with basic text editors.
Interoperability: Virtually all spreadsheet programs (Excel, Google Sheets, LibreOffice Calc) and data analysis tools can import CSV files effortlessly.
Goal Alignment: You mentioned potentially adding this data to ebible_status.csv later. Having it already in CSV makes that integration simpler.
Lightweight: It's a very storage-efficient format for this kind of data.
While JSON could represent the nested structure ({book: {chapter: verse}}) more directly, it adds slight overhead for reading/writing and might be less convenient for quick inspection in a spreadsheet, which seems like a common use case here. YAML is even more human-readable but less standard for pure data exchange.

Given the straightforward, tabular nature of the desired output and the likely downstream uses (manual review, spreadsheet import, potential merging with other CSVs), CSV is a pragmatic and effective choice.

I have put @paratext.py in the ebible_code folder. That contains functions for parsing SFM files. It is copied from the SILNLP repo so the environments will need to be modified. However there are probably some useful functions in that script that mean this one doesn't have to parse the SFM itself but can rely on those functions.


Gemini
Okay, that's a good idea! Using existing, robust parsing functions from paratext.py (presumably based on SIL's machine.corpora or similar) can definitely make the count_verses.py script cleaner and potentially more reliable than relying solely on basic regex line parsing.

Assuming paratext.py provides access to something like machine.corpora.ParatextTextCorpus, we can refactor parse_project_verse_counts to use it. This corpus class typically handles the complexities of SFM parsing internally and allows iteration over verses.

Here's how we can modify count_verses.py:

Refactoring Steps:

Import: Add the necessary import from machine.corpora (assuming paratext.py makes this available or uses it internally).
Replace Parsing Logic: Modify parse_project_verse_counts to instantiate ParatextTextCorpus and iterate through its verses instead of reading files line by line.
Extract Verse Info: Get the book, chapter, and verse number (handling subdivisions) from the objects yielded by the corpus.
Maintain Functionality: Ensure the subdivision logging and output generation remain the same.
Potential Considerations:

Dependencies: This change introduces a dependency on the library providing ParatextTextCorpus (likely machine or silnlp). Ensure your environment is set up correctly.
Error Handling: Add error handling around the corpus instantiation and iteration, as ParatextTextCorpus might raise exceptions for malformed SFM or missing files.
Performance: For very large projects, initializing the full corpus might have different performance characteristics than the line-by-line regex approach. However, for correctness and robustness, using the dedicated corpus class is generally preferred.
Verse String Format: The exact way verse numbers (especially with subdivisions like '1a') are represented by ParatextTextCorpus might vary. We'll adapt the parsing of the verse number accordingly.
Let's apply these changes.

Explanation of Changes:

Import: Added a try...except block to import ParatextTextCorpus and VerseRef from machine.corpora. A flag HAS_PARATEXT_CORPUS is set to conditionally run the new logic.
parse_project_verse_counts Refactoring:
Checks HAS_PARATEXT_CORPUS at the beginning.
Removes the manual file finding, opening, and line-reading loops.
Instantiates ParatextTextCorpus(str(project_path)).
Iterates through corpus.verse_refs. This assumes verse_refs yields objects (VerseRef) that have .book, .chapter, and .verse attributes. (Note: The exact attribute names or method might differ slightly depending on the specific version of machine/silnlp).
Uses a helper function parse_verse_string with regex (\d+)([a-zA-Z]?) to extract the numeric part and optional subdivision character from the verse_ref.verse string.
Updates the verse_counts dictionary using the numeric verse number.
Logs subdivisions found (without the specific filename, as that's less accessible via the corpus object).
Adds try...except blocks to handle errors during corpus initialization (e.g., FileNotFoundError) or processing.
Adds a check if no verses were processed, issuing a warning.
Regex Update: The V_PATTERN used for line parsing is removed, and a new VERSE_STR_PATTERN is added specifically for parsing the verse string obtained from the VerseRef object.
Now, count_verses.py leverages the more sophisticated parsing capabilities of ParatextTextCorpus, reducing the amount of manual SFM handling code within this script itself. Remember to ensure the necessary libraries are installed in your environment.

How can I interogate the ParatextTextCorpus object in order to learn how to make use of it? I imagine that this is a fairly useful thing to be able to do when making use of classes written by others.

Okay, exploring objects like ParatextTextCorpus to understand their structure and capabilities is a fundamental skill in Python, often called introspection. Python provides several built-in tools for this.

Here are some common ways to interrogate an object like corpus:

dir(object): This is often the first step. It returns a list of valid attributes and methods for that object. It shows you what names you can access using dot notation (e.g., corpus.attribute, corpus.method()).

type(object): Tells you the exact class of the object (e.g., <class 'machine.corpora.paratext_text_corpus.ParatextTextCorpus'>). This helps confirm you're working with the object you expect.

help(object): This is very useful! It displays the object's docstring (if it has one), which usually explains what the class or method does, its parameters, and what it returns. You can use it on the class itself (help(ParatextTextCorpus)) or an instance (help(corpus)). You can also use it on specific methods (help(corpus.texts)).

vars(object): Returns the __dict__ attribute of an object, which stores its writable attributes (instance variables). This can give you a direct look at the object's internal state, but be aware that not all attributes might be stored here (e.g., properties, slots).

inspect module: For more advanced introspection, the inspect module offers functions like inspect.getmembers(object) (similar to dir but returns name-value pairs), inspect.signature(callable) (to see function/method parameters), inspect.getdoc(object) (to get the docstring), etc. Your attrs function is already using inspect.getmembers.

Applying to ParatextTextCorpus in your code:

Looking at your count_verses.py script, you've already started doing this with show_attrs and some print statements. Let's refine the parse_project_verse_counts function to demonstrate these techniques and correct the iteration.

The primary way to get verse references from ParatextTextCorpus is usually via the verse_refs property, which yields VerseRef objects. Iterating directly over the corpus object itself often yields TextRow objects (representing lines/segments of text), which might not be what you want for just counting verses per chapter.

Let's adjust the debugging part of your parse_project_verse_counts function to use verse_refs and demonstrate introspection:

Explanation:

Import VerseRef: Added from machine.scripture import VerseRef to allow using help(VerseRef).
Introspection Block: Added a section after corpus is created to demonstrate type(), dir(), and accessing specific attributes like versification. It also shows how to get the count of texts.
Inspect VerseRef: It now tries to get the first VerseRef object from corpus.verse_refs using next(iter(...), None). If successful, it prints its type, value, dir(), and calls help(VerseRef) to show the documentation for that specific class. This tells you about attributes like .book, .chapter, .verse, .bbbcccvvv, etc.
exit(): I added a commented-out exit() call. You can uncomment this if you only want to run the script to see the introspection output without proceeding to the actual verse counting and CSV writing.
Correct Iteration: The main loop now correctly iterates over corpus.verse_refs as intended for getting verse references.
parse_verse_string: Added the helper function back in, assuming it was intended to be there based on the previous diff.
By running the script with these changes (and potentially uncommenting the exit()), you can examine the output of dir() and help() to learn exactly what properties and methods are available on both the ParatextTextCorpus instance and the VerseRef objects it yields, guiding you on how to use them effectively.

There are useful tools for introspection in that. It would be great to have an introspection function to which I can pass an object. Then I can recursively pass not only the ParatextTextCorpus, but also the objects that it contains.

Okay, creating a recursive introspection function is a great way to explore complex objects like those from libraries. It helps you understand their structure and how different parts relate to each other.

Here's a function introspect_object that you can add to your count_verses.py script. It will print information about an object and recursively call itself on its non-basic attributes, up to a specified depth, while avoiding infinite loops.

        print(f"{indent}* Already visited object of type {type(obj).__name__} (id: {obj_id})")

                  introspect_object(member_obj, depth - 1, indent + "    ", visited.copy()) # Pass copy of visited

    # Remove from visited set when returning from this level?
    # Depends on whether you want to allow revisiting via different paths.
    # For now, keep it simple: once visited in a call stack, don't revisit.
    # If you remove: visited.remove(obj_id)
Now, you can use this function within parse_project_verse_counts to explore the corpus object and its contents.

How to Use:

Replace the existing introspection code block in parse_project_verse_counts with the call to introspect_object(corpus, depth=...).
Adjust the depth parameter (e.g., depth=1 or depth=2) to control how many levels deep you want to explore. Higher depths give more detail but can produce a lot of output. depth=0 will just show info about the top-level object itself.
Uncomment the exit() line if you want the script to stop after printing the introspection details.
Run the script.
This introspect_object function should give you a much clearer picture of the ParatextTextCorpus object and the objects it contains, like the VerseRef objects yielded by verse_refs.

The ParatextTextCorpus object has a versification object. The versification object has methods that look like they will be very useful: - get_last_book (method): <bound method Versification.get_last_book of <machine.scripture.verse_ref.Versif... - get_last_chapter (method): <bound method Versification.get_last_chapter of <machine.scripture.verse_ref.Ver... - get_last_verse <bound method Versification.get_last_verse of <machine.scripture.verse_ref.Versi...

It will be necessary to clearly understand what they do. Does get_last_book mean get the last book processed by code, or get the final book in the corpus? Does get_last_verse get the last verse of a given chapter? It would also be interesting to know what the parse function does and how to use it.

Okay, let's break down those methods from the Versification object. These are indeed very useful for understanding the structure defined by a specific versification system (like the one loaded from Settings.xml or inferred by ParatextTextCorpus).

Based on the naming conventions and common usage in libraries dealing with scripture references, here's what those methods likely do:

get_last_book():

Meaning: This method almost certainly returns the book number of the last canonical book defined within that specific versification system. It's about the definition of the canon according to that .vrs file or standard, not about the last book processed in your code or the last book present in a particular Bible text corpus.
Example Usage:
python
corpus = ParatextTextCorpus(str(project_path))
versification = corpus.versification # Get the Versification object
last_book_num = versification.get_last_book()
print(f"The last book number in this versification is: {last_book_num}")
# You could potentially convert this number back to a book ID if needed
# (though the Versification object itself might not have a direct method for that,
# you might use functions from machine.scripture like book_num_to_id if available)
get_last_chapter(book_num):

Meaning: This method takes a book_num (the integer representation of a book, e.g., 1 for Genesis, 40 for Matthew) and returns the highest chapter number defined for that specific book within that versification system.
Example Usage:
python
corpus = ParatextTextCorpus(str(project_path))
versification = corpus.versification
book_num_gen = 1 # Genesis
last_chapter_gen = versification.get_last_chapter(book_num_gen)
print(f"The last chapter defined for Genesis (Book {book_num_gen}) is: {last_chapter_gen}") # Should be 50 for most versifications

book_num_psa = 19 # Psalms
last_chapter_psa = versification.get_last_chapter(book_num_psa)
print(f"The last chapter defined for Psalms (Book {book_num_psa}) is: {last_chapter_psa}") # Should be 150 for most
get_last_verse(book_num, chapter_num):

Meaning: This method takes both a book_num and a chapter_num and returns the highest verse number defined for that specific chapter within that specific book, according to that versification system. This is exactly what you were extracting manually by iterating through verse_refs before!
Example Usage:
python
corpus = ParatextTextCorpus(str(project_path))
versification = corpus.versification
book_num_gen = 1
chapter_num_gen1 = 1
last_verse_gen1 = versification.get_last_verse(book_num_gen, chapter_num_gen1)
print(f"The last verse defined for Genesis {chapter_num_gen1} is: {last_verse_gen1}") # Should be 31

book_num_jhn = 43 # John
chapter_num_jhn3 = 3
last_verse_jhn3 = versification.get_last_verse(book_num_jhn, chapter_num_jhn3)
print(f"The last verse defined for John {chapter_num_jhn3} is: {last_verse_jhn3}") # Should be 36
parse(vref_str):

Meaning: This method takes a string representation of a verse reference (e.g., "GEN 1:1", "Jn 3:16") and attempts to parse it into a VerseRef object. Crucially, it interprets the book abbreviation and potentially the chapter/verse structure according to the rules and mappings defined within that specific Versification object. This is useful if you have verse references as strings from external sources or user input and need to convert them into structured VerseRef objects that align with the Bible text's versification.
Example Usage:
python
corpus = ParatextTextCorpus(str(project_path))
versification = corpus.versification

vref_str1 = "GEN 1:1"
vref_obj1 = versification.parse(vref_str1)
print(f"Parsed '{vref_str1}' -> {vref_obj1} (Book: {vref_obj1.book_num}, Chapter: {vref_obj1.chapter_num}, Verse: {vref_obj1.verse_num})")

vref_str2 = "Mrk 10:8" # Using a different abbreviation
try:
    vref_obj2 = versification.parse(vref_str2)
    print(f"Parsed '{vref_str2}' -> {vref_obj2}")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Could not parse '{vref_str2}' using this versification's rules: {e}")

# Example showing potential difference (hypothetical)
# Imagine a versification where Psalm 23:1 is mapped differently
vref_str_psa = "PSA 23:1"
vref_obj_psa = versification.parse(vref_str_psa)
print(f"Parsed '{vref_str_psa}' -> {vref_obj_psa}")
# The resulting vref_obj_psa might have different internal properties
# if this versification maps PSA 23:1 to something else internally.
These methods provide a powerful, standardized way to query the structural definition of a versification system without needing to parse the .vrs file or the SFM text yourself for that specific information. Using get_last_verse would be a much more direct way to get the maximum verse count per chapter than iterating through all verse_refs.
