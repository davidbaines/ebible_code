I would like to modify the get versification code so that it is more heuristic and therefore more robust. Versifications are more like guidelines or traditions than rules. Few Bibles actually follow a given Versification system perfectly. It's more the case that a versification can be written from any Bible and there are some well-known Bibles whose versification has been used by other translators.

There are specifications for each. For example the @vul.vrs I've placed one of these vrs file for each versification, in the assets folder. Lines begining with # are comments. Some of the comments provide very useful information for understanding which books should be present. The code isn't expected to read those, of course, but they may be useful to help a human make a decicion about which versification to use. Lines begining with a bookid list the number of verses in each chapter. This is the main data the script would need to parse and use. Some vrs files may not specify all books. That would be a major clue that if the book is present in the Bible it probably isn't using a versification that omits that book. Some Bibles will have chapters that are not present in a given versification, again that would be a clue that that Bible isn't following that versification. We have to take into account the fact that many of the Bibles are not fully translated yet - so missing books are more likely because they are not yet translated.

We could count the number of verses in each Bible. Then count how many of the Books, Chapters and Verses present are also present in each Versification. For the chapters that exist in the Bible we could count how many have exactly the correct number of verses as defined by each versification. For Books that exist in the Bible we can check whether those books are also in each versification. All these could then be combined in some way to give a score, for how similar the Bible is to each versification.

Are there other things I'd need to consider here? Is any clarification required?

Here is a sample of the vul.vrs file.

Okay, this sounds like a fascinating and practical challenge! Building a heuristic to suggest the most likely versification system for a given Bible text, especially considering incomplete translations, is a great goal. Your proposed approach of comparing book/chapter presence and verse counts is a solid foundation.

Let's break down the factors and potential additions:

Core Comparison Points (As you suggested):

Book Presence:
Bible Books vs. Versification Books: Check which books present in the Bible are also defined in the .vrs file. A high overlap is a positive signal.
Versification Books vs. Bible Books: Check if the .vrs file defines books not found in the Bible. This is a weaker negative signal due to incomplete translations, but significant omissions (like a .vrs defining deuterocanonical books when the Bible clearly has none) can be informative.
Chapter Presence (within shared books):
For books found in both the Bible and the .vrs file, check which chapters present in the Bible are also defined in the .vrs file for that book.
Again, check if the .vrs defines chapters not present in the Bible for a shared book. This is also a weak signal due to partial work.
Verse Count Matching (within shared chapters):
This is likely your strongest signal. For chapters found in both the Bible and the .vrs file, compare the maximum verse number. Count how many chapters have an exact match.
Developing the Scoring Heuristic:

Weighting: You'll need to assign weights to the comparison points. Intuitively:
Verse Count Matching should have the highest weight.
Book Presence should have a significant weight (especially regarding canonical differences like Apocrypha/Deuterocanon).
Chapter Presence might have the lowest weight, as it's most susceptible to being skewed by incomplete work.
Normalization: To compare scores across different .vrs files fairly, you need normalization. A good approach might be to base the score on the content present in the Bible being analyzed:
Book Score: (Number of Bible books also in .vrs) / (Total number of books in Bible)
Chapter Score: (Number of Bible chapters also in .vrs for shared books) / (Total number of Bible chapters in shared books)
Verse Count Score: (Number of shared chapters with matching verse counts) / (Total number of shared chapters)
Combined Score: (W1 * Book Score) + (W2 * Chapter Score) + (W3 * Verse Count Score)
This focuses on how well a versification explains the data you have, mitigating the impact of missing (potentially untranslated) data.
Other Things to Consider:

Verse Mappings (= lines): The .vrs files contain explicit verse mapping information (e.g., EXO 8:1-4 = EXO 7:26-29). This defines precise differences like verse splits, merges, or renumberings between the versification described and a reference standard (often BHS/GNT/LXX).
Potential: If you could parse these mapping rules and check if the specific verse numbers at these known difference points in your Bible text match the .vrs definition, it would be a very powerful heuristic signal, much stronger than just max verse counts. For example, does the Bible text have content at EXO 7:26-29 or EXO 8:1-4? Matching the .vrs side of the equation (EXO 8:1-4 in this case for Vulgate) would strongly indicate that versification.
Complexity: This significantly increases parsing complexity. You'd need to handle ranges, potential one-to-many or many-to-one mappings, and access specific verse content/presence in the Bible data, not just chapter counts.
Handling Incompleteness: Your normalization approach helps, but be mindful: a Bible with only Genesis translated might perfectly match the Genesis entry in multiple .vrs files. The heuristic will be more reliable as more of the Bible is present. Perhaps add a "confidence" metric based on the amount of Bible text analyzed.
Canonical Differences: The presence or absence of Deuterocanonical/Apocryphal books (like Tobit, Judith, Wisdom, Sirach, Baruch, 1/2 Maccabees in the Vulgate .vrs) is a major clue. Your Book Presence check should heavily factor this in. Some .vrs files might explicitly exclude them.
Specific Book Variations: Note the comments in vul.vrs about Esther (Hebrew vs. Greek length/chapters) and Daniel (inclusion of additions like Susanna, Bel and the Dragon). If your Bible data includes chapter/verse counts for these specific variations, it can help distinguish between .vrs files (e.g., DAN 3:100 vs DAN 3:33).
Verse Subdivisions: The .vrs sometimes implies subdivisions (e.g., EST 3:15 in NVL98 having 15a-i). Your current plan uses the max verse number (15). If your Bible data could distinguish between EST 3:15 and EST 3:15i, you could potentially refine the Verse Count Matching, but this is likely an edge case and adds complexity.
Multiple Matches: Don't expect a single perfect score. It's more likely you'll get a ranked list (e.g., "Vulgate: 85%, KJV: 60%, LXX: 45%"). Presenting the top few matches is probably the best output.
Data Source: How will you get the book/chapter/verse counts from the Bible text? Is it parsed from USFM, queried from a database, etc.? This affects implementation. Ensure consistent Book ID usage (the .vrs uses 3-letter codes).
Clarification Required:

Is the added complexity of parsing and comparing the specific verse mappings (= lines) desirable and feasible given your Bible data access, or should the focus remain on the simpler book/chapter presence and max verse counts?
How is the Bible data (book list, chapter list per book, verse count per chapter) being obtained?
Your initial plan is a great start, and focusing on the three main comparison points with careful weighting and normalization will likely yield good results. Adding the verse mapping check would be the next level of sophistication if feasible.

The Book, Chapter and verse list need to be obtained by parsing the *.SFM files in each Bible project folder. Only the \id \c and \v markers need to be parsed. \v markers without text, if they exist are a good indication that the translator intends to translate that number of verses in that chapter. When we look at the specific verse mappings we have to be careful how they are interpeted. in the example given: EXO 8:1-4 = EXO 7:26-29 both a Bible following the Vulgate vrs and one following all the others are expected to contain verses 8:4-1 since there more than 8 chapters. We can't tell if the meaning of the translation in verses 8:1-4 is the same. However if we found that in the Vulgate EXO chapter 7 is shorter because those verses have been moved to the begining of chapter 8, and we find that chapter 8 is longer that's a good indication. This information should however already be represented in the EXO line. Therefore let's not try to make use of those specific verse mappings. Let's begin with a Book Score weight of 2, a chapter score weight of 1 and a verse count score weight of 2.5. We can test and iterate with those later. The Bible SFM files can contain letter divisions of the verses following the pattern \v \d{1,3}[a-zA-Z] though other wordforming charaters may be used in other scripts. If there is more than one letter following it should be considered an error. That is most likely a missing space before the first word of the verse. I think there are few examples of these subdivided verses and we should simply count those as one verse. (Let's add code to note which Bibles have these somewhere in them - that wiil be a guide to how important they might be.)

We could start by producing and testing a script that will parse the SFM files and list the Books, Chapters, and verses in each. This information could potentially be added to the ebible_status.csv file for each file. Or stored as a per-project csv file in the project folder. That might be better to begin with and can be revisited later. Is this a good way forward?

Okay, that sounds like a very sensible and pragmatic approach!

Yes, starting by creating a script to parse the SFM files and extract the structural information (Book ID, Chapter Number, Max Verse Number per Chapter) is an excellent way forward.

Here's why this is a good plan:

Modular Development: It breaks the larger problem down into a manageable, distinct task. You can focus solely on correctly interpreting the SFM structure first.
Creates Necessary Input: The output of this script (the structural data for a Bible) is the essential input needed for the next step – comparing against the .vrs files.
Testable Unit: You can easily test this SFM parsing script against various Bible projects to ensure it correctly handles different SFM files, including those with empty verse markers or verse subdivisions, before worrying about the comparison logic.
Intermediate Data: Storing this parsed structure in a per-project CSV file is a great idea. It provides:
A snapshot of the Bible's structure for review.
A persistent data source, so you don't need to re-parse the SFM files every time you want to run the versification comparison (unless the Bible files change).
A clear separation between data extraction and data analysis (the heuristic scoring).
Regarding your specific points:

SFM Parsing (\id, \c, \v): This is the correct focus. You need the book identifier, the start of each chapter, and the verse markers within each chapter.
Empty \v Markers: Counting these is crucial, as they represent the intended structure, even if text isn't present yet. Your parser should find the highest verse number mentioned (or implied by an empty marker) within each chapter.
Verse Subdivisions (\v 1a, etc.): Your plan to treat \v 1a, \v 1b, etc., as contributing only to the count for verse 1 (i.e., finding the maximum numeric verse part) is standard practice and avoids unnecessary complexity at this stage. Logging occurrences of these subdivisions (\v \d+[a-zA-Z]) is a good secondary goal to understand their prevalence. You'll need a regular expression to capture the number and the optional letter separately.
Excluding = Mappings: Agree completely. While potentially useful for fine-grained analysis, the chapter/verse counts derived from the main book lines in the .vrs file capture the most significant structural differences. Ignoring the = lines simplifies the initial implementation considerably.
Weighting: The proposed weights (Book: 2, Chapter: 1, Verse Count: 2.5) are a reasonable starting point. Verse count matching is often the strongest indicator, so giving it the highest weight makes sense. These can definitely be tuned later based on testing.
Output CSV: A simple Book,Chapter,MaxVerse CSV file per project is perfect for the initial output.
Next Steps Outline:

Develop the SFM Parser:
Function to find all .SFM (or .sfm, case-insensitive) files in a given project directory.
Logic to iterate through lines of each file.
State variables to keep track of the current book_id and chapter_num.
A data structure (like a dictionary nested within a dictionary: results[book_id][chapter_num] = max_verse) to store the maximum verse number found for each chapter.
A list or set to store detected verse subdivisions (book_id chapter:verse_subdivision).
Regular expressions to identify and extract data from \id, \c, and \v markers. The \v regex should capture the number and the optional single letter separately.
Update the max_verse for the current chapter whenever a \v marker with a higher numeric part is encountered.
Handle potential errors gracefully (e.g., a \v marker before a \c).
Write Output:
After processing all files for a project, write the contents of the results data structure to a CSV file (e.g., _versification_data.csv) within that project's folder.
Optionally, print or write the log of verse subdivisions found.
Test: Run the parser on a few different Bible projects (ideally ones you suspect use different versifications) and manually check the output CSVs for accuracy.
Once you have this SFM parser working reliably, you'll be in a great position to tackle the next phase: parsing the .vrs files and implementing the scoring heuristic.

Would you write a new script to do this parsing? Please avoid the os module in preference for the pathlib path module. Let's call the output .csv verse_counts_<translation_id>.csv and put it in the project's own folder - the same one that contains the SFM files. Is csv the best output format?

How to Use:

Save the code above as a Python file (e.g., parse_sfm_verse_counts.py).
Open your terminal or command prompt.
Run the script, providing the path to the project folder as an argument:
bash
python parse_sfm_verse_counts.py /path/to/your/bible/project_folder
(Replace /path/to/your/bible/project_folder with the actual path).
The script will:
Print progress messages to the console.
Create a CSV file named verse_counts_<folder_name>.csv inside the specified project folder.
Print a list of any detected verse subdivisions (like GEN 1:1a) to the console.
Is CSV the best output format?

For this specific purpose, yes, CSV is likely the best format.

Simplicity: The structure (Book, Chapter, MaxVerse) is inherently tabular, making CSV a natural fit.
Readability: It's easily human-readable and editable with basic text editors.
Interoperability: Virtually all spreadsheet programs (Excel, Google Sheets, LibreOffice Calc) and data analysis tools can import CSV files effortlessly.
Goal Alignment: You mentioned potentially adding this data to ebible_status.csv later. Having it already in CSV makes that integration simpler.
Lightweight: It's a very storage-efficient format for this kind of data.
While JSON could represent the nested structure ({book: {chapter: verse}}) more directly, it adds slight overhead for reading/writing and might be less convenient for quick inspection in a spreadsheet, which seems like a common use case here. YAML is even more human-readable but less standard for pure data exchange.

Given the straightforward, tabular nature of the desired output and the likely downstream uses (manual review, spreadsheet import, potential merging with other CSVs), CSV is a pragmatic and effective choice.

I have put @paratext.py in the ebible_code folder. That contains functions for parsing SFM files. It is copied from the SILNLP repo so the environments will need to be modified. However there are probably some useful functions in that script that mean this one doesn't have to parse the SFM itself but can rely on those functions.


Gemini
Okay, that's a good idea! Using existing, robust parsing functions from paratext.py (presumably based on SIL's machine.corpora or similar) can definitely make the count_verses.py script cleaner and potentially more reliable than relying solely on basic regex line parsing.

Assuming paratext.py provides access to something like machine.corpora.ParatextTextCorpus, we can refactor parse_project_verse_counts to use it. This corpus class typically handles the complexities of SFM parsing internally and allows iteration over verses.

Here's how we can modify count_verses.py:

Refactoring Steps:

Import: Add the necessary import from machine.corpora (assuming paratext.py makes this available or uses it internally).
Replace Parsing Logic: Modify parse_project_verse_counts to instantiate ParatextTextCorpus and iterate through its verses instead of reading files line by line.
Extract Verse Info: Get the book, chapter, and verse number (handling subdivisions) from the objects yielded by the corpus.
Maintain Functionality: Ensure the subdivision logging and output generation remain the same.
Potential Considerations:

Dependencies: This change introduces a dependency on the library providing ParatextTextCorpus (likely machine or silnlp). Ensure your environment is set up correctly.
Error Handling: Add error handling around the corpus instantiation and iteration, as ParatextTextCorpus might raise exceptions for malformed SFM or missing files.
Performance: For very large projects, initializing the full corpus might have different performance characteristics than the line-by-line regex approach. However, for correctness and robustness, using the dedicated corpus class is generally preferred.
Verse String Format: The exact way verse numbers (especially with subdivisions like '1a') are represented by ParatextTextCorpus might vary. We'll adapt the parsing of the verse number accordingly.
Let's apply these changes.

Explanation of Changes:

Import: Added a try...except block to import ParatextTextCorpus and VerseRef from machine.corpora. A flag HAS_PARATEXT_CORPUS is set to conditionally run the new logic.
parse_project_verse_counts Refactoring:
Checks HAS_PARATEXT_CORPUS at the beginning.
Removes the manual file finding, opening, and line-reading loops.
Instantiates ParatextTextCorpus(str(project_path)).
Iterates through corpus.verse_refs. This assumes verse_refs yields objects (VerseRef) that have .book, .chapter, and .verse attributes. (Note: The exact attribute names or method might differ slightly depending on the specific version of machine/silnlp).
Uses a helper function parse_verse_string with regex (\d+)([a-zA-Z]?) to extract the numeric part and optional subdivision character from the verse_ref.verse string.
Updates the verse_counts dictionary using the numeric verse number.
Logs subdivisions found (without the specific filename, as that's less accessible via the corpus object).
Adds try...except blocks to handle errors during corpus initialization (e.g., FileNotFoundError) or processing.
Adds a check if no verses were processed, issuing a warning.
Regex Update: The V_PATTERN used for line parsing is removed, and a new VERSE_STR_PATTERN is added specifically for parsing the verse string obtained from the VerseRef object.
Now, count_verses.py leverages the more sophisticated parsing capabilities of ParatextTextCorpus, reducing the amount of manual SFM handling code within this script itself. Remember to ensure the necessary libraries are installed in your environment.

How can I interogate the ParatextTextCorpus object in order to learn how to make use of it? I imagine that this is a fairly useful thing to be able to do when making use of classes written by others.

Okay, exploring objects like ParatextTextCorpus to understand their structure and capabilities is a fundamental skill in Python, often called introspection. Python provides several built-in tools for this.

Here are some common ways to interrogate an object like corpus:

dir(object): This is often the first step. It returns a list of valid attributes and methods for that object. It shows you what names you can access using dot notation (e.g., corpus.attribute, corpus.method()).

type(object): Tells you the exact class of the object (e.g., <class 'machine.corpora.paratext_text_corpus.ParatextTextCorpus'>). This helps confirm you're working with the object you expect.

help(object): This is very useful! It displays the object's docstring (if it has one), which usually explains what the class or method does, its parameters, and what it returns. You can use it on the class itself (help(ParatextTextCorpus)) or an instance (help(corpus)). You can also use it on specific methods (help(corpus.texts)).

vars(object): Returns the __dict__ attribute of an object, which stores its writable attributes (instance variables). This can give you a direct look at the object's internal state, but be aware that not all attributes might be stored here (e.g., properties, slots).

inspect module: For more advanced introspection, the inspect module offers functions like inspect.getmembers(object) (similar to dir but returns name-value pairs), inspect.signature(callable) (to see function/method parameters), inspect.getdoc(object) (to get the docstring), etc. Your attrs function is already using inspect.getmembers.

Applying to ParatextTextCorpus in your code:

Looking at your count_verses.py script, you've already started doing this with show_attrs and some print statements. Let's refine the parse_project_verse_counts function to demonstrate these techniques and correct the iteration.

The primary way to get verse references from ParatextTextCorpus is usually via the verse_refs property, which yields VerseRef objects. Iterating directly over the corpus object itself often yields TextRow objects (representing lines/segments of text), which might not be what you want for just counting verses per chapter.

Let's adjust the debugging part of your parse_project_verse_counts function to use verse_refs and demonstrate introspection:

Explanation:

Import VerseRef: Added from machine.scripture import VerseRef to allow using help(VerseRef).
Introspection Block: Added a section after corpus is created to demonstrate type(), dir(), and accessing specific attributes like versification. It also shows how to get the count of texts.
Inspect VerseRef: It now tries to get the first VerseRef object from corpus.verse_refs using next(iter(...), None). If successful, it prints its type, value, dir(), and calls help(VerseRef) to show the documentation for that specific class. This tells you about attributes like .book, .chapter, .verse, .bbbcccvvv, etc.
exit(): I added a commented-out exit() call. You can uncomment this if you only want to run the script to see the introspection output without proceeding to the actual verse counting and CSV writing.
Correct Iteration: The main loop now correctly iterates over corpus.verse_refs as intended for getting verse references.
parse_verse_string: Added the helper function back in, assuming it was intended to be there based on the previous diff.
By running the script with these changes (and potentially uncommenting the exit()), you can examine the output of dir() and help() to learn exactly what properties and methods are available on both the ParatextTextCorpus instance and the VerseRef objects it yields, guiding you on how to use them effectively.

There are useful tools for introspection in that. It would be great to have an introspection function to which I can pass an object. Then I can recursively pass not only the ParatextTextCorpus, but also the objects that it contains.

Okay, creating a recursive introspection function is a great way to explore complex objects like those from libraries. It helps you understand their structure and how different parts relate to each other.

Here's a function introspect_object that you can add to your count_verses.py script. It will print information about an object and recursively call itself on its non-basic attributes, up to a specified depth, while avoiding infinite loops.

python

        print(f"{indent}* Already visited object of type {type(obj).__name__} (id: {obj_id})")
        return

    visited.add(obj_id)

        try:

            if len(member_repr) > 80:

    # Remove from visited set when returning from this level?
    # Depends on whether you want to allow revisiting via different paths.
    # For now, keep it simple: once visited in a call stack, don't revisit.
    # If you remove: visited.remove(obj_id)
Now, you can use this function within parse_project_verse_counts to explore the corpus object and its contents.

How to Use:

Replace the existing introspection code block in parse_project_verse_counts with the call to introspect_object(corpus, depth=...).
Adjust the depth parameter (e.g., depth=1 or depth=2) to control how many levels deep you want to explore. Higher depths give more detail but can produce a lot of output. depth=0 will just show info about the top-level object itself.
Uncomment the exit() line if you want the script to stop after printing the introspection details.
Run the script.
This introspect_object function should give you a much clearer picture of the ParatextTextCorpus object and the objects it contains, like the VerseRef objects yielded by verse_refs.

The ParatextTextCorpus object has a versification object. The versification object has methods that look like they will be very useful: - get_last_book (method): <bound method Versification.get_last_book of <machine.scripture.verse_ref.Versif... - get_last_chapter (method): <bound method Versification.get_last_chapter of <machine.scripture.verse_ref.Ver... - get_last_verse <bound method Versification.get_last_verse of <machine.scripture.verse_ref.Versi...

It will be necessary to clearly understand what they do. Does get_last_book mean get the last book processed by code, or get the final book in the corpus? Does get_last_verse get the last verse of a given chapter? It would also be interesting to know what the parse function does and how to use it.


Gemini
Okay, let's break down those methods from the Versification object. These are indeed very useful for understanding the structure defined by a specific versification system (like the one loaded from Settings.xml or inferred by ParatextTextCorpus).

Based on the naming conventions and common usage in libraries dealing with scripture references, here's what those methods likely do:

get_last_book():

Meaning: This method almost certainly returns the book number of the last canonical book defined within that specific versification system. It's about the definition of the canon according to that .vrs file or standard, not about the last book processed in your code or the last book present in a particular Bible text corpus.
Example Usage:
python
corpus = ParatextTextCorpus(str(project_path))
versification = corpus.versification # Get the Versification object
last_book_num = versification.get_last_book()
print(f"The last book number in this versification is: {last_book_num}")
# You could potentially convert this number back to a book ID if needed
# (though the Versification object itself might not have a direct method for that,
# you might use functions from machine.scripture like book_num_to_id if available)
get_last_chapter(book_num):

Meaning: This method takes a book_num (the integer representation of a book, e.g., 1 for Genesis, 40 for Matthew) and returns the highest chapter number defined for that specific book within that versification system.
Example Usage:
python
corpus = ParatextTextCorpus(str(project_path))
versification = corpus.versification
book_num_gen = 1 # Genesis
last_chapter_gen = versification.get_last_chapter(book_num_gen)
print(f"The last chapter defined for Genesis (Book {book_num_gen}) is: {last_chapter_gen}") # Should be 50 for most versifications

book_num_psa = 19 # Psalms
last_chapter_psa = versification.get_last_chapter(book_num_psa)
print(f"The last chapter defined for Psalms (Book {book_num_psa}) is: {last_chapter_psa}") # Should be 150 for most
get_last_verse(book_num, chapter_num):

Meaning: This method takes both a book_num and a chapter_num and returns the highest verse number defined for that specific chapter within that specific book, according to that versification system. This is exactly what you were extracting manually by iterating through verse_refs before!
Example Usage:
python
corpus = ParatextTextCorpus(str(project_path))
versification = corpus.versification
book_num_gen = 1
chapter_num_gen1 = 1
last_verse_gen1 = versification.get_last_verse(book_num_gen, chapter_num_gen1)
print(f"The last verse defined for Genesis {chapter_num_gen1} is: {last_verse_gen1}") # Should be 31

book_num_jhn = 43 # John
chapter_num_jhn3 = 3
last_verse_jhn3 = versification.get_last_verse(book_num_jhn, chapter_num_jhn3)
print(f"The last verse defined for John {chapter_num_jhn3} is: {last_verse_jhn3}") # Should be 36
parse(vref_str):

Meaning: This method takes a string representation of a verse reference (e.g., "GEN 1:1", "Jn 3:16") and attempts to parse it into a VerseRef object. Crucially, it interprets the book abbreviation and potentially the chapter/verse structure according to the rules and mappings defined within that specific Versification object. This is useful if you have verse references as strings from external sources or user input and need to convert them into structured VerseRef objects that align with the Bible text's versification.
Example Usage:
python
corpus = ParatextTextCorpus(str(project_path))
versification = corpus.versification

vref_str1 = "GEN 1:1"
vref_obj1 = versification.parse(vref_str1)
print(f"Parsed '{vref_str1}' -> {vref_obj1} (Book: {vref_obj1.book_num}, Chapter: {vref_obj1.chapter_num}, Verse: {vref_obj1.verse_num})")

vref_str2 = "Mrk 10:8" # Using a different abbreviation
try:
    vref_obj2 = versification.parse(vref_str2)
    print(f"Parsed '{vref_str2}' -> {vref_obj2}")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Could not parse '{vref_str2}' using this versification's rules: {e}")

# Example showing potential difference (hypothetical)
# Imagine a versification where Psalm 23:1 is mapped differently
vref_str_psa = "PSA 23:1"
vref_obj_psa = versification.parse(vref_str_psa)
print(f"Parsed '{vref_str_psa}' -> {vref_obj_psa}")
# The resulting vref_obj_psa might have different internal properties
# if this versification maps PSA 23:1 to something else internally.
These methods provide a powerful, standardized way to query the structural definition of a versification system without needing to parse the .vrs file or the SFM text yourself for that specific information. Using get_last_verse would be a much more direct way to get the maximum verse count per chapter than iterating through all verse_refs.

Would you put these methods, and the others we have discussed so far into a script that would do the following: Given a paratext project folder it would find which books exist and get the last verse of each chapter. It would get the last verse whether or not there is data in the verse. Then in the project folder write that information in the .vrs format. Let's name the file <project>.vrs, where project is the name of the folder containing the SFM files.

We will want the code to search subfolders of the given folder for Paratext projects. These can be defined as folders containing .SFM files or .usfm files (both can be case insensitve) and also a Settings.xml file. Please create a function is_paratext_folder(candidate: Path): -> bool That returns whether or not a folder 'looks like' a paratext project. With that we the code will be able to take the EBIBLE_DATA_DIR environment variable, find the projects folder and add the <project>.vrs file to each of them. Are there any other things I need to consider here? The purpose of this will be to faciliate the comparison of the various common versification systems with those of each project for the purpose of detemining the closest common versification system to the one used by the project.

Okay, this is a very useful utility! Generating a .vrs file directly from the content of each Paratext project will indeed be invaluable for comparing its structure against known versification systems.

Here's a Python script, generate_project_vrs.py, that implements the functionality you've described. It will:

Define is_paratext_folder to identify valid project directories.
Recursively scan a root directory (defaulting to EBIBLE_DATA_DIR).
For each project, parse its SFM files using ParatextTextCorpus.
Determine the maximum verse number for each chapter present in the project.
Write this information into a <project_name>.vrs file within that project's folder, sorted canonically.

To make this script runnable and use it:

Save the code: Save the code above as generate_project_vrs.py in your c:\ebible_code\ebible_code\ directory.
Ensure Dependencies: Make sure you have the sil-machine library installed in your Python environment. If not, you can usually install it with pip install sil-machine.
Set Environment Variable (Optional): If you want to use the EBIBLE_DATA_DIR environment variable, make sure it's set to the path of your main eBible data folder (e.g., F:/GitHub/BibleNLP/ebible).
Run the script:
To scan EBIBLE_DATA_DIR (or a directory specified by command line):
bash
cd c:\ebible_code\ebible_code
python generate_project_vrs.py
or
bash
python generate_project_vrs.py /path/to/your/root_projects_directory
To process a single project folder:
bash
python generate_project_vrs.py --project_folder /path/to/specific/paratext_project
Key features of this script:

is_paratext_folder: Correctly identifies project folders based on your criteria.
Recursive Scanning: Uses rglob to find projects in subdirectories.
ParatextTextCorpus Usage: Leverages the SIL library for robust SFM parsing.
Actual Max Verse Calculation: Iterates through corpus.verse_refs to find the true maximum verse number for each chapter present in the SFM files, respecting empty verse markers.
.vrs File Generation:
Creates a file named <project_folder_name>.vrs inside each project directory.
Includes a header with project name and generation date.
Lists books in a canonical order (based on BOOK_ORDER).
Formats chapter and verse counts as C:V.
Error Handling & Logging: Includes basic logging for progress and errors.
Command-line Arguments: Allows specifying a root directory or a single project folder.
Other things to consider (as per your question):

Performance: For a very large number of projects or very large projects, the script might take some time. ParatextTextCorpus initialization and iteration can be I/O and CPU intensive. This is generally acceptable for a utility script.
SFM Validity: The script relies on ParatextTextCorpus to handle the SFM. If SFM files are severely malformed, the corpus might raise errors or skip data, which would be reflected in the generated .vrs file (or lack thereof for that project).
Definition of "Last Verse": The current implementation correctly interprets "last verse" as the highest verse number marked in the SFM for a given chapter, which aligns with your requirement of "whether or not there is data in the verse."
Book ID Consistency: The script uses the book ID as provided by verse_ref.book.upper(). Ensure these IDs are consistent with what your .vrs comparison logic expects (typically standard 3-letter uppercase USFM book codes).
Custom Versifications within Projects: If a project has a very unusual or non-standard versification that ParatextTextCorpus struggles to map to its internal VerseRef system correctly (e.g., highly fragmented chapters, non-numeric verse identifiers not handled by parse_verse_string), the output might be affected. However, for most Paratext projects, this should work well.
verse_ref.verse parsing: The current parse_verse_string and its usage (verse_ref.verse.split('-')[0]) assumes that verse_ref.verse will be a string like "1", "1a", or "1-3". If ParatextTextCorpus yields VerseRef objects where verse_ref.verse_num (integer) and verse_ref.verse_num_str (string like "1a") are more direct attributes for the verse number, using those might be slightly cleaner. However, the current approach should generally work.
This script provides a solid foundation for your goal of comparing project versifications. The generated .vrs files will accurately represent the structure found within each project's SFM data.

I have simplified the argument parsing, so that it will accept a single paratext folder or search recursively automatically.

I'm getting this error: Traceback (most recent call last): File "C:\ebible_code\ebible_code\generate_project_vrs.py", line 232, in <module> main() File "C:\ebible_code\ebible_code\generate_project_vrs.py", line 214, in main

Gemini
It looks like the ParatextTextCorpus object in the version of the sil-machine library you're using doesn't have a direct attribute named verse_refs.

Typically, to iterate over the verses in a ParatextTextCorpus, you iterate directly over the corpus object itself. Each item yielded is usually a TextRow object (or similar), which then has an attribute (commonly ref) that holds the VerseRef object.

Let's adjust the loop in generate_vrs_from_project to reflect this common usage pattern.

generate_project_vrs.py
-2
+3
    verse_data = defaultdict(lambda: defaultdict(int))
    processed_verse_refs = 0

    for verse_ref in corpus.verse_refs:
    for text_row in corpus: # Iterate directly over the corpus
        processed_verse_refs += 1
        book_id = verse_ref.book.upper() # Ensure uppercase book ID
        verse_ref = text_row.ref # Get the VerseRef from the TextRow
        book_id = verse_ref.book.upper() 
        chapter_num = verse_ref.chapter
        # verse_ref.verse can be like '1', '1a', '1-2', '1a-2b'
        # We need the primary numeric part of the first verse in a range or segment.

Explanation of the change:

The line for verse_ref in corpus.verse_refs: is changed to for text_row in corpus:.
Inside the loop, verse_ref = text_row.ref is added to get the VerseRef object from the text_row.
This modification aligns with how ParatextTextCorpus objects are commonly iterated to access individual verse references. Give this a try, and it should resolve the AttributeError.

Gemini
It looks like the chapter_num variable is still a string when you're trying to compare it with an integer. The VerseRef object from the machine.scripture library often stores chapter and verse numbers as strings. You'll need to explicitly convert verse_ref.chapter to an integer.

Here's the suggested change:

generate_project_vrs.py
-1
+1
        processed_verse_refs += 1
        verse_ref = text_row.ref # Get the VerseRef from the TextRow
        book_id = verse_ref.book.upper() 
        chapter_num = verse_ref.chapter
        chapter_num = int(verse_ref.chapter) # Convert chapter to int
        # verse_ref.verse can be like '1', '1a', '1-2', '1a-2b'
        # We need the primary numeric part of the first verse in a range or segment.
        # For '1-2', parse_verse_string('1-2') might fail if not handled.

By changing chapter_num = verse_ref.chapter to chapter_num = int(verse_ref.chapter), you ensure that chapter_num is an integer, which will allow the comparison chapter_num > 0 to work correctly.

Now we have the project.vrs file and vrs files for the common versification systems. How can we compare the project vrs files with each common versification vrs file One interesting output we could easily create is a single csv file that lists every chapter for every book, in the usual canonnical book order for the Original versification system. Then populate the rows with the number of verses in each versification system, and then for those of each project. Are the requirements clear? Could you write a script that will do thi?


Gemini
Okay, this is a very useful next step! Creating a consolidated CSV to compare chapter lengths across all your projects and standard versifications will give you a great overview.

The requirements are clear:

Identify all canonical Book-Chapter pairs. The "Original" versification system is a good baseline for ordering, but we should aim to include any chapter present in any of the provided .vrs files to be comprehensive.
For each Book-Chapter, list the number of verses as defined by:
Each common versification system (from .vrs files in an assets folder).
Each project (from their respective <project_name>.vrs files).
Output this as a single CSV file.
Here's a Python script, compare_versifications.py, that will do this. It uses pandas for easier data manipulation and CSV output, especially for handling missing values (when a chapter isn't in a particular versification).

How to Use This Script:

Save: Save the code as compare_versifications.py in your c:\ebible_code\ebible_code\ directory.
Install pandas: If you don't have pandas, install it: pip install pandas
Prepare Inputs:
Make sure your common .vrs files (e.g., vul.vrs, eng.vrs) are in a dedicated directory (e.g., c:\ebible_code\assets\).
Ensure your Paratext project folders (e.g., under F:/GitHub/BibleNLP/ebible/projects/ and F:/GitHub/BibleNLP/ebible/private_projects/) each contain their respective <project_name>.vrs file (generated by the previous generate_project_vrs.py script).
Run from the command line:
bash
cd c:\ebible_code\ebible_code

python compare_versifications.py ^
    --common_vrs_dir "c:\ebible_code\assets" ^
    --projects_dirs "F:\GitHub\BibleNLP\ebible\projects" "F:\GitHub\BibleNLP\ebible\private_projects" ^
    --output_csv "c:\ebible_code\versification_comparison.csv"
Adjust the paths for --common_vrs_dir, --projects_dirs (you can list multiple), and --output_csv as needed.
Explanation:

Constants: BOOK_ORDER and BOOK_SORT_KEY are used for canonical sorting of books.
parse_vrs_file(vrs_path):
Takes a path to a .vrs file.
Reads the file line by line.
Skips comments (#) and empty lines.
Uses regex to find lines starting with a 3-character BookID followed by chapter:verse pairs.
Parses these pairs and stores them in a dictionary: {BookID: {ChapterNum: MaxVerse}}.
find_vrs_files(directory, pattern): A helper to get a list of .vrs files from a directory.
find_project_vrs_files(projects_root_dirs):
Scans the specified project root directories.
For each subdirectory (assumed to be a project folder), it looks for a file named <project_folder_name>.vrs.
Returns a dictionary mapping the project name to the path of its .vrs file.
main() function:
Argument Parsing: Sets up command-line arguments for input directories and the output file.
Finding and Parsing VRS Files:
Calls find_vrs_files for the common .vrs directory.
Calls find_project_vrs_files for the project directories.
Parses each found .vrs file using parse_vrs_file. The results are stored in all_parsed_vrs, keyed by a source name (e.g., "vul" for vul.vrs, or the project name for project-specific files).
Master Book-Chapter List:
It iterates through all the parsed data from all .vrs files.
It collects every unique (BookID, ChapterNum) pair it encounters into a set (master_book_chapter_set) to ensure no duplicates.
This set is then converted to a list and sorted canonically (first by book order, then by chapter number). This sorted_master_list defines the rows of your output CSV.
Preparing Data for DataFrame:
It iterates through the sorted_master_list. For each (BookID, ChapterNum):
A new row dictionary is created, starting with {"Book": BookID, "Chapter": ChapterNum}.
It then iterates through all the source_names (like "vul", "engESV", etc.) that were parsed.
For each source, it tries to get the verse count for the current BookID and ChapterNum. If found, it's added to the row; otherwise, None is added (which pandas will turn into NaN). The column name is f"{source_name}_verses".
Creating and Saving CSV:
A pandas DataFrame is created from the output_data_list.
Columns are reordered to ensure "Book" and "Chapter" are first.
The DataFrame is saved to the specified output CSV file.
This script should give you the comprehensive comparison table you're looking for!

Can we add default values to each of the command line arguments - then they would all be optional and the code will know the defaults based on the environment variable EBIBLE_DATA_DIR.

The standard vrs files are in EBIBLE_DATA_DIR/assests. The projects are in EBIBLE_DATA_DIR/projects and the output file will be EBIBLE_DATA_DIR/metadata/compare_versifications.csv

compare_versifications.py: 1 lines selected

Gemini
Okay, I can help you with that! We can modify the argparse setup to make all arguments optional and provide default values based on the EBIBLE_DATA_DIR environment variable.

Here's how we can adjust the main() function:

compare_versifications.py
-5
+26
    return project_vrs_map


def get_default_paths():
    """Gets default paths based on EBIBLE_DATA_DIR environment variable."""
    ebible_data_dir_str = os.getenv("EBIBLE_DATA_DIR")
    if not ebible_data_dir_str:
        logger.error("EBIBLE_DATA_DIR environment variable is not set. Cannot determine default paths.")
        sys.exit(1)
    
    base_path = Path(ebible_data_dir_str)
    defaults = {
        "common_vrs_dir": base_path / "assets",
        "projects_dirs": [base_path / "projects"], # Default to a list with one item
        "output_csv": base_path / "metadata" / "compare_versifications.csv"
    }
    return defaults


def main():
    default_paths = get_default_paths()

    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(
        description="Compares verse counts from multiple .vrs files and project-specific .vrs files."
    )
    parser.add_argument(
        "--common_vrs_dir",
        type=Path,
        required=False,
        help="Directory containing common .vrs files (Defaults to the EBIBLE_DATA_DIR/assets/ folder).",
        default=default_paths["common_vrs_dir"],
        help=f"Directory containing common .vrs files. Defaults to: {default_paths['common_vrs_dir']}",
    )
    parser.add_argument(
        "--projects_dirs",
        type=Path,
        nargs='+',
        required=False
        help="Root directory/directories containing Paratext project folders (each with a <project_name>.vrs).",
        required=False,
        default=default_paths["projects_dirs"],
        help=f"Root directory/directories containing Paratext project folders. Defaults to: {default_paths['projects_dirs']}",
    )
    parser.add_argument(
        "--output_csv",
        type=Path,
        required=False,
        help="Path to save the output comparison CSV file.",
        default=default_paths["output_csv"],
        help=f"Path to save the output comparison CSV file. Defaults to: {default_paths['output_csv']}",
    )
    args = parser.parse_args()

    # --- 1. Find and parse all VRS files ---
    all_parsed_vrs: Dict[str, Dict[str, Dict[int, int]]] = {} # {source_name: {book: {chap: verse}}}

    
    # Parse common VRS files
    logger.info(f"Looking for common VRS files in: {args.common_vrs_dir}")
    common_vrs_files = find_vrs_files(args.common_vrs_dir)

Key changes:

get_default_paths() function:
This new helper function retrieves the EBIBLE_DATA_DIR environment variable.
If the variable is not set, it logs an error and exits, as the defaults cannot be determined.
It constructs the default Path objects for common_vrs_dir, projects_dirs (as a list), and output_csv.
argparse.ArgumentParser modifications:
required=False is now set for all arguments, making them truly optional.
The default parameter for each argument is set using the values from default_paths.
The help strings are updated to dynamically show the determined default path, making it clear to the user.
With these changes, if the user doesn't provide any command-line arguments, the script will use the paths derived from EBIBLE_DATA_DIR. If EBIBLE_DATA_DIR is not set, the script will inform the user and exit gracefully.

This is excellent. There are many classes and functions that might be possible to reuse in the machine.py repo on this machine. the verse_ref.py file is in F:\GitHub\machine.py How can I make that repo accessible to you - Gemini code assist?


Gemini
It's great that you're thinking about reusing code from your local machine.py repository! That's a smart way to leverage existing, potentially well-tested, functionalities.

Unfortunately, as a large language model, I don't have direct access to your local file system or private repositories on your machine (like F:\GitHub\machine.py). My knowledge is based on the vast dataset I was trained on, and I can only interact with information you provide directly in our conversation or through publicly accessible URLs if I were designed to fetch them (which I'm not, for security and privacy reasons).

However, there are several effective ways you can "make that repo accessible" to me in the context of our collaboration, so I can help you integrate its components:

Provide Relevant Code Snippets: This is the most common and often the best approach.

When you have a specific function, class, or module from machine.py that you think is relevant to the task at hand (like VerseRef or parsing utilities), you can copy and paste that code directly into our chat.
Pros: Precise, focused, and I get exactly the code I need to understand its interface and suggest how to use it.
Cons: Can be cumbersome if you need to share many large files or complex interdependencies.
Example: "I have this VerseRef class in machine.py/machine/scripture/verse_ref.py: python\nclass VerseRef:\n # ... (code here) ...\n How can I use its to_string() method in my compare_versifications.py script?"
Describe the API/Functionality: If pasting the whole code is too much, you can describe the relevant parts.

Tell me the function/method signatures (name, parameters, return type).
Explain what the function/class does.
Mention any important attributes or behaviors.
Pros: Good for a high-level understanding or when you only need to integrate a small part.
Cons: I might miss nuances if the description isn't detailed enough, leading to less accurate suggestions.
Example: "My machine.py has a function get_book_name(book_id: str) -> str that converts a 3-letter book ID to its full name. How can I call this?"
Summarize Key Structures and Logic: For more complex interactions, you can explain the overall design.

"The ParatextProject class in machine.py has a method .get_setting(key) that reads from Settings.xml."
Pros: Helps me understand how different pieces might fit together.
Cons: Still relies on your accurate summarization.
Use a Public Git Repository (if appropriate): If machine.py is something you're willing and able to make public (or if it's already a fork of a public project), you could push it to a service like GitHub or GitLab. Then you could share links to specific files or commits.

Pros: I could (theoretically, if I had browsing capabilities) see the full context. However, I currently cannot browse live URLs. So, you'd still likely be copying snippets from there. The main benefit here is for your organization and if you collaborate with others.
Cons: Not suitable for private or proprietary code.
What I recommend for our current interaction:

Start with snippets: When you identify a specific piece of machine.py (like a class definition or a utility function) that you want to use in compare_versifications.py or generate_project_vrs.py, paste that code.
Ask specific questions: "How can I import and use class X from this snippet in my script Y?" or "Given this function Z from machine.py, how would I modify my current loop to use it?"
By providing the relevant code or a clear description of its API, I can give you the most accurate and helpful assistance in integrating it into your ebible_code project. I'm ready when you are!

Great. I copied verse_ref.py to this repo. There is a class VersificationType with this definition:

plaintext: 8 lines selected
There is Versification Class with this definition:

plaintext: 288 lines selected
I'd like to do two things in order: One import from this file some thing simple to test the importing and use of these to prove that it is possible. (Later I'd like to see how we can refactor code to make the most use of these.) Let's just start with a test though. For example, can we use the VersificationType class to give us the order of the versifications. Then read the vrs files for those and include them as the first columns (after the book and chapter columns) in that order?


Gemini
Okay, that's a great plan! Using the VersificationType enum from your verse_ref.py to define the order of the common versification columns in your output CSV is an excellent way to test the import and start integrating these classes.

Here's how we can modify compare_versifications.py to achieve this:

1. Ensure verse_ref.py is importable:

Make sure that c:\ebible_code\ebible_code\verse_ref.py is in a location where Python can find it. Since compare_versifications.py is also in c:\ebible_code\ebible_code\, you should be able to import from verse_ref directly. However, verse_ref.py itself has relative imports like from ..utils.comparable import Comparable. This implies it's part of a larger package structure.

To make this work correctly, you'll likely need to ensure that the parent directory of machine (which would be F:\GitHub\machine.py if verse_ref.py is at F:\GitHub\machine.py\machine\scripture\verse_ref.py) is in your PYTHONPATH, or you adjust the imports within your local copy of verse_ref.py if you're treating c:\ebible_code\ebible_code as the top-level for this specific file.

For the simplest test, assuming verse_ref.py and its dependencies (canon.py, and the utils folder) are correctly placed relative to c:\ebible_code\ebible_code\ such that the imports resolve, we can proceed. If verse_ref.py is intended to be part of a package named machine that resides elsewhere, you'd typically install that package or adjust sys.path.

Let's assume for now that verse_ref.py (and its dependencies like canon.py and the utils directory from the machine.py repo) are placed within c:\ebible_code\ebible_code\ in a way that Python can resolve from ..utils.comparable import Comparable (e.g., by having a utils subdirectory there). If not, you'll hit an ImportError for those ..utils imports.

        row = {"Book": book_id, "Chapter": chapter_num}

Explanation of Changes:

Import Attempt:

Added a try-except block at the top to attempt importing VersificationType from your local verse_ref.py.
A flag CAN_IMPORT_VERSE_REF is set. If the import fails, it prints a warning and will fall back to alphabetical sorting of columns.
Column Ordering Logic (inside main()):

If CAN_IMPORT_VERSE_REF is True:
A dictionary vtype_to_stem is created to map VersificationType enum members to the expected file stem names (e.g., VersificationType.VULGATE to "vul"). You might need to expand this map if your .vrs files in assets use different naming conventions than the enum members directly suggest or if _BUILTIN_VERSIFICATION_FILENAMES in verse_ref.py is the better source for these stems.
It iterates through VersificationType enum members in their defined order.
For each vtype, it checks if a corresponding stem exists in the all_parsed_vrs keys (which are derived from the filenames in your assets and project directories).
If a match is found, the original source name (from all_parsed_vrs.keys(), preserving case) is added to common_vrs_ordered_names.
Any other common VRS files (found in common_vrs_dir but not explicitly mapped via VersificationType) are added alphabetically after the enum-ordered ones.
Project VRS names (those not in the ordered common list) are then added, sorted alphabetically.
source_names (which dictates column order) is constructed by concatenating common_vrs_ordered_names and project_vrs_names.
If CAN_IMPORT_VERSE_REF is False:
It falls back to the previous behavior: source_names = sorted(all_parsed_vrs.keys()).
A log message now prints the final determined order of source_names.
To make this work, you need to address the import dependencies of verse_ref.py:

The file c:\ebible_code\ebible_code\verse_ref.py contains lines like:

python
from ..utils.comparable import Comparable
from ..utils.file_utils import detect_encoding, detect_encoding_from_stream
from ..utils.string_utils import is_integer, parse_integer
from ..utils.typeshed import StrPath
from .canon import LAST_BOOK, book_id_to_number, book_number_to_id, is_canonical
These ..utils and .canon imports mean that verse_ref.py expects to be part of a package structure.

Option A: Replicate the necessary structure within ebible_code (Simpler for a quick test):

Create a subdirectory c:\ebible_code\ebible_code\utils\.
Copy the required files (comparable.py, file_utils.py, string_utils.py, typeshed.py) from F:\GitHub\machine.py\machine\utils\ into c:\ebible_code\ebible_code\utils\.
Make sure c:\ebible_code\ebible_code\utils\__init__.py exists (it can be empty).
Copy canon.py from F:\GitHub\machine.py\machine\scripture\ into c:\ebible_code\ebible_code\.
You might also need an __init__.py in c:\ebible_code\ebible_code\ if it's being treated as the top of a package for these files.
Option B: Add F:\GitHub\machine.py to PYTHONPATH (More robust if you plan to use more from machine.py):

Set the PYTHONPATH environment variable to include F:\GitHub\machine.py.
How you do this depends on your OS and how you run Python.
For example, in a Windows command prompt for the current session: set PYTHONPATH=F:\GitHub\machine.py;%PYTHONPATH%
Or, you can add it programmatically at the very beginning of your script (less ideal for shared code but works for testing):
python
import sys
sys.path.insert(0, 'F:/GitHub/machine.py') # Or the parent of the 'machine' package
# ... rest of your imports
Then, in compare_versifications.py, you would import like this:
python
from machine.scripture.verse_ref import VersificationType
# from machine.scripture.canon import ... (if needed directly)
And verse_ref.py's internal imports (from ..utils...) should resolve correctly because Python knows where the machine package root is.
Recommendation:

For this initial test, Option A (replicating the minimal necessary structure within c:\ebible_code\ebible_code) might be the quickest way to get the import working, provided you copy all direct and indirect dependencies of VersificationType and Versification.

Once you've sorted out the imports, running compare_versifications.py should now attempt to order the columns for common versifications based on the VersificationType enum. Remember to adjust the vtype_to_stem mapping if your .vrs filenames in the assets folder don't directly correspond to the simplified stems I used (e.g., if you have English.vrs instead of eng.vrs).

Oh - sorry. I want to start without trying to copy parts of the machine.py repo into this one. That would defeat the main idea of reusing code, by duplicating it and having to maintain it in two places. I want to test all the parts necessary for importing from machine.py. That will likely mean checking the PYTHONPATH environment variable is correct and maybe other things. That's very helpful to know. What's a minimum change I can make to the code to test that importing VersificationType from the installed machine.py repo is working?


Gemini
You're absolutely right! Copying code defeats the purpose of reuse. The best approach is to ensure your environment is set up so Python can find the installed machine library (from machine.py repo).

Let's make a minimal change to c:\ebible_code\ebible_code\compare_versifications.py to test if you can import VersificationType from the machine.scripture.verse_ref module, assuming machine is properly installed or its path is correctly in PYTHONPATH.

Minimal Test:

The simplest test is to add an import statement and perhaps print something from the imported class to confirm it loaded. We can do this at the top of the compare_versifications.py script.

Here's the diff:

import pandas as pd # For DataFrame and CSV output

# Attempt to import from the local verse_ref.py
# --- Test import from installed machine.scripture ---
try:
    from verse_ref import VersificationType
    # from verse_ref import Versification # We might use this later
    from machine.scripture.verse_ref import VersificationType
    print(f"Successfully imported VersificationType: {VersificationType.ENGLISH}") # Test print
    CAN_IMPORT_VERSE_REF = True
except ImportError as e:
    print(f"Warning: Could not import from verse_ref.py: {e}. Versification column ordering will be alphabetical.", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"ERROR: Could not import 'VersificationType' from 'machine.scripture.verse_ref': {e}", file=sys.stderr)
    print("Please ensure the 'sil-machine' library is installed and accessible in your PYTHONPATH.", file=sys.stderr)
    CAN_IMPORT_VERSE_REF = False
    # sys.exit(1) # Optionally exit if the import is critical

# --- Logging Setup ---
log_format = '%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(name)s - %(message)s'

Explanation of this minimal change:

Import Statement:
from machine.scripture.verse_ref import VersificationType
This attempts to import VersificationType directly from the machine package, specifically its scripture.verse_ref submodule. This is how you'd typically import from an installed library.
Test Print:
print(f"Successfully imported VersificationType: {VersificationType.ENGLISH}")
If the import succeeds, this line will execute and print a confirmation message along with one of the enum values. This gives you immediate visual feedback.
Error Handling:
The try-except ImportError block remains.
The error message is updated to reflect that it's trying to import from machine.scripture.verse_ref.
I've commented out sys.exit(1). For this initial test, you might want the script to continue (and fall back to alphabetical sorting) even if the import fails, so you can see other potential issues. Later, if this import becomes critical, you can uncomment the exit.
How to Test:

Ensure machine is "installed" or on PYTHONPATH:

If machine.py is a proper Python package you've developed: The ideal way is to install it in your environment, e.g., using pip install -e /path/to/your/machine.py/repo (for an editable install) or by building a wheel and installing that.
If you're just pointing to the source directory: Make sure the parent directory of the machine folder (i.e., F:\GitHub if your machine package is at F:\GitHub\machine.py\machine) is in your PYTHONPATH environment variable.
Example (Windows, temporary for current cmd session): set PYTHONPATH=F:\GitHub\machine.py;%PYTHONPATH%
Verify PYTHONPATH: In Python, you can run import sys; print(sys.path) to see all paths Python searches for modules.
Run compare_versifications.py:

bash
cd c:\ebible_code\ebible_code
python compare_versifications.py
Expected Outcomes:

Success: You'll see the message: Successfully imported VersificationType: VersificationType.ENGLISH printed at the beginning, and the script will proceed (likely using alphabetical sorting for now, as the logic to use VersificationType for ordering is still there but might not fully align with the stems if vtype_to_stem isn't perfectly matched yet).
Failure (ImportError): You'll see the ERROR: Could not import 'VersificationType'... message. This indicates Python cannot find the machine.scripture.verse_ref module. The most common reasons are:
The sil-machine library (or your custom machine.py package) is not installed in the Python environment you're using.
PYTHONPATH is not set correctly to point to the location of your machine.py source code.
There might be an issue within the machine.scripture.verse_ref module itself or its own dependencies that prevents it from being imported (e.g., a syntax error, or it can't find its own relative imports like from ..utils...).
This minimal change directly tests the crucial step of importing from your machine.py repository as if it were an installed library. Once this works, you can then confidently proceed to integrate more of its classes and functionalities.

The sil-machine library is (or should be) installed. It is listed in the pyproject.toml file. poetry install works, though with the warning

It sounds like you're encountering a classic Python import issue related to how packages and relative imports are handled, especially when a file is run as a script versus being part of an imported package.

The error message "attempted relative import with no known parent package" is the key here. It's appearing for two reasons:

When compare_versifications.py tries from verse_ref import VersificationType: If verse_ref.py (your local copy) is in the same directory and you run python compare_versifications.py, Python doesn't inherently know that c:\ebible_code\ebible_code is supposed to be a package. So, when verse_ref.py itself tries to do from ..utils.comparable import Comparable, it fails because there's no "parent package" (..) recognized from its perspective when it's loaded this way.
When compare_versifications.py tries from machine.scripture.verse_ref import VersificationType: This is more surprising if sil-machine is correctly installed via Poetry. However, the same error message suggests that the verse_ref.py within the installed sil-machine library is encountering this issue. This can happen if the sil-machine package itself has some internal relative imports that are not resolving correctly in the context of how it's being loaded or if there's a conflict.
Let's address the poetry install warning first, as it might be related or indicate a slight misconfiguration in how Poetry views your ebible project.

Poetry Install Warning:

The warning No file/folder found for package ebible means Poetry is trying to install your ebible project itself as a package, but it can't find a standard package layout (e.g., an ebible subdirectory containing an __init__.py, or a src/ebible layout).

If your ebible_code directory is intended to be an installable package named ebible: You should structure it like one. A common way is:

plaintext
c:\ebible_code\
    pyproject.toml
    README.md
    ebible\          <-- This is your package
        __init__.py
        compare_versifications.py
        generate_project_vrs.py
        verse_ref.py  <-- If you keep a local copy for modification
        utils\        <-- If you copied utils
            __init__.py
            comparable.py
            ...
        ... other modules ...
Then, your pyproject.toml would correctly refer to this ebible package.

If your ebible_code directory is just a collection of scripts and not meant to be an installable package itself: The --no-root flag during poetry install is indeed the way to tell Poetry not to try and install the current project. This is perfectly fine for a project that primarily consists of scripts that use other libraries.

Addressing the Import Error:

The core issue is that the verse_ref.py (whether it's your local copy or the one inside the installed sil-machine library) uses relative imports like from ..utils.comparable import Comparable. These imports only work when the file is part of a package that Python recognizes and has loaded as such.

Let's focus on using the sil-machine library as installed by Poetry. This is the most robust and maintainable approach.

Hypothesis for the machine.scripture.verse_ref import error:

Even if sil-machine is installed, if the verse_ref.py within that installed package is somehow being executed or imported in a context where Python doesn't see it as part of the machine package, its internal relative imports will fail. This is less common for well-packaged libraries but can happen due to: * PYTHONPATH conflicts: If your PYTHONPATH accidentally includes a directory that makes Python find a different (and perhaps broken or incomplete) version of machine or its submodules before the Poetry-installed one. * Issues with the sil-machine packaging itself (less likely for a published library, but possible). * The way poetry run python ... sets up the environment might interact oddly in some edge cases, though usually, it's reliable.

Recommended Steps to Debug and Fix:

Clean up PYTHONPATH (for testing): Temporarily ensure your PYTHONPATH environment variable is empty or does not contain paths that could conflict with Poetry's environment. Poetry manages its own environment, and an explicit PYTHONPATH can sometimes interfere.

Verify sil-machine installation by Poetry:

Run poetry show sil-machine. This should confirm it's installed and show its version.
You can also try a very simple Python script run with poetry run:
python
# test_sil_import.py
try:
    from machine.scripture.verse_ref import VersificationType
    print(f"SUCCESS: Imported VersificationType: {VersificationType.ENGLISH}")
    import machine.utils.comparable # Try importing one of the relative dependencies
    print(f"SUCCESS: Imported machine.utils.comparable: {machine.utils.comparable.Comparable}")
except ImportError as e:
    print(f"ERROR: {e}")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"OTHER ERROR: {e}")

import sys
print("\nPython sys.path:")
for p in sys.path:
    print(p)
Run it: poetry run python test_sil_import.py This will tell you:
If the basic import works.
If a submodule that verse_ref.py depends on via relative import can be imported directly using its absolute path from the machine package.
The sys.path that poetry run is using, which can be very insightful. You should see a path pointing to your Poetry virtual environment's site-packages directory, where sil-machine (and thus the machine package) should reside.
Ensure no local verse_ref.py is interfering (for this test): For the purpose of testing the installed sil-machine library, temporarily rename your local c:\ebible_code\ebible_code\verse_ref.py to something like verse_ref_local_backup.py. This ensures that when compare_versifications.py does from machine.scripture.verse_ref import VersificationType, it's definitely trying to load from the installed library and not your local copy (which might then fail on its own relative imports if not part of a recognized package structure).

Modify compare_versifications.py to only use the installed library: The minimal test you had previously was good. Let's ensure it's robustly trying to use the installed package.

# --- Logging Setup ---
log_format = '%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(name)s - %(message)s'

If the test_sil_import.py script fails with the "attempted relative import" error when trying to import VersificationType or machine.utils.comparable:

This would strongly suggest an issue with either: a. The sil-machine==1.6.2 package itself (how it's structured or packaged). b. A very specific environment interaction with Poetry on your system.

In such a case: * Double-check the sys.path output from test_sil_import.py. Is the path to the sil-machine library (e.g., .../.venv/Lib/site-packages/machine) present and correct? * You might try creating a completely fresh minimal Poetry project, add only sil-machine, and try the test_sil_import.py there to isolate the problem from your ebible project. bash mkdir test-sil cd test-sil poetry init -n poetry add sil-machine # copy test_sil_import.py here poetry run python test_sil_import.py

The goal is to get from machine.scripture.verse_ref import VersificationType working reliably by leveraging the Poetry-managed installation of sil-machine. Once that single import works, the rest of the integration should be much smoother.

Now the import is working! That's great. by looking at the @sample_verse_ref.py file can you see which parts of that might be useful for refactoring this code to make it more robust by making use of the well tested code?
Are there any ways to use that to simplfy this code?
Can we also work on adding the verse counts from the versification
