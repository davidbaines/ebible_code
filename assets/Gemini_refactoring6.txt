There was discussion earlier, captured in the Gemini_refactoring4.txt file that discusses how to use verse counts to determine the versification. The verse counts are now captured and stored in the EBIBLE_DATA_DIR/metadata/compare_versifications.csv file. That file also includes the verse counts for the standard versification systems in the first columns after the Book and Chapter columns.

Here is a sample containing coulmn names and the first two rows of data:

plaintext: 3 lines selected
Use the data in the compare_versifications.csv to calculate the closest versification for each file.
Update the Settings.xml line to reflect that versification. &lt;Versification&gt;4&lt;/Versification&gt; for English for example. What other information is required to complete this task? Are any clarifications needed.

Okay, this is the logical next step: using the compare_versifications.csv to heuristically determine the best standard versification for each project and then updating their Settings.xml files.

Based on the discussion in Gemini_refactoring4.txt and your current setup, here's a plan and the script to implement it:

Plan:

Read Configuration:

Load the compare_versifications.csv file into a pandas DataFrame.
Identify which columns represent standard versifications (e.g., "Original_verses", "English_verses") and which represent project versifications (e.g., "aai_verses").
Create a mapping from the standard versification names (like "English") to their VersificationType enum members and thus to the integer value required for Settings.xml.
For Each Project:

Extract the project's verse count data from the DataFrame.
Iterate through each standard versification:
Extract the standard's verse count data.
Calculate the following scores, normalizing by the project's content:
Book Score: (Number of project books also defined in the standard versification) / (Total number of books in the project). Weight: 2.0.
Chapter Score: (Number of project chapters in common books also defined in the standard versification) / (Total number of project chapters in common books). Weight: 1.0.
Verse Count Score: (Number of project chapters in common books that have an exact verse count match with the standard versification) / (Total number of project chapters in common books). Weight: 2.5.
Calculate a Combined Score using the weighted sum of the above.
Identify the standard versification with the highest combined score for the current project.
Determine the integer ID for this winning VersificationType.
Update Settings.xml:

Locate the project's Settings.xml file (e.g., EBIBLE_DATA_DIR/projects/<project_id>/Settings.xml).
Parse the XML file.
Find the <Versification> element.
Update its text content with the new integer ID.
Write the changes back to Settings.xml, preserving existing XML structure as much as possible.
Prerequisites:

The compare_versifications.csv file must exist in EBIBLE_DATA_DIR/metadata/.
The sil-machine library must be installed and importable for VersificationType and Versification.
The EBIBLE_DATA_DIR environment variable must be set.
Project folders should be in EBIBLE_DATA_DIR/projects/ or EBIBLE_DATA_DIR/private_projects/ (or other locations if the script is adapted).
Here's the Python script to perform these actions:

How to Run:

Save the code above as update_project_versification_settings.py in your c:\ebible_code\ebible_code\ directory.
Ensure EBIBLE_DATA_DIR is set and compare_versifications.csv exists in the metadata subfolder.
Open your terminal/command prompt, navigate to c:\ebible_code\ebible_code\.
Run the script:
Dry Run (recommended first):
bash
poetry run python update_project_versification_settings.py --dry_run
Actual Run (to modify Settings.xml files):
bash
poetry run python update_project_versification_settings.py
You can also specify paths if they differ from the defaults:
bash
poetry run python update_project_versification_settings.py --csv_file /path/to/your.csv --project_dirs /path/to/projects1 /path/to/projects2
Key Points in the Script:

Standard Versification Map (get_standard_versification_map): Uses Versification.get_builtin(vtype).name to get the canonical names (e.g., "English", "Vulgate") which are assumed to match the prefixes in your CSV column names (e.g., "English_verses").
Data Extraction (get_project_data_from_df): Pulls data for a specific project or standard versification from the main DataFrame, converting it into a {(book, chapter): verses} dictionary and handling NaN values by dropping them.
Scoring Logic (calculate_similarity_score): Implements the weighted scoring based on book presence, chapter presence (in common books), and verse count matches (in common chapters). Normalization is done against the project's content.
XML Update (update_settings_xml): Uses xml.etree.ElementTree to parse, find the <Versification> tag, update its text, and write the file back. It's basic but should work for this specific tag update.
Dry Run Mode: The --dry_run flag allows you to see what changes would be made without actually modifying any files.
Project Directory Discovery: The script iterates through the provided --project_dirs to find the folder for each project_id to locate its Settings.xml.
This script should provide a good solution for automating the update of versification settings based on your heuristic. Remember to review the dry run output carefully before running it live.

Could we add this to the compare_versifications.py script and maybe rename that to update_versifications.py. Then the pandas dataframe is already available.


Gemini
Okay, this is a great idea! Combining these two scripts will streamline the workflow, allowing you to generate the comparison CSV and then immediately use it to update project settings, all in one go. The pandas DataFrame can indeed be passed directly, avoiding the need to write and then re-read the CSV if both operations are performed in the same run.

Here's how we can modify compare_versifications.py, rename it to update_versifications.py, and integrate the functionality:

1. Rename the file: Manually rename c:\ebible_code\ebible_code\compare_versifications.py to c:\ebible_code\ebible_code\update_versifications.py.

2. Apply the following changes to the (newly renamed) update_versifications.py file:

Key Changes and Explanations:

Filename: The conceptual rename to update_versifications.py.
New Imports: xml.etree.ElementTree as ET.
Scoring Weights: Added WEIGHT_BOOK, WEIGHT_CHAPTER, WEIGHT_VERSE_COUNT.
Helper Functions for Update Logic:
get_standard_versification_map(): Determines mapping from standard versification names to their VersificationType enum and integer value.
get_data_from_df_for_scoring(): (Renamed from get_project_data_from_df to avoid potential confusion and to clarify its role with the main DataFrame). Extracts verse count data for a specific column (project or standard) from the main DataFrame.
calculate_similarity_score(): Calculates the heuristic score.
update_settings_xml(): Updates the <Versification> tag in Settings.xml.
main() Function Restructuring:
The main() function now orchestrates two main phases.
Argument Parsing: New arguments --skip_csv_generation, --skip_settings_update, and --dry_run are added to control the script's behavior. The --output_csv argument is renamed to --csv_file as it's now used for both output and potential input.
generate_comparison_csv(args) function: Encapsulates the original logic of compare_versifications.py to produce the CSV. It now returns the generated DataFrame.
update_versification_settings(df, args) function: Encapsulates the logic from the previous update_project_versification_settings.py script. It takes the DataFrame (either freshly generated or loaded) and updates Settings.xml files.
DataFrame Flow:
If CSV generation is active, the resulting DataFrame (comparison_df) is passed directly to update_versification_settings.
If CSV generation is skipped, update_versification_settings attempts to load the DataFrame from the --csv_file.
Column Identification for Update Logic:
standard_vrs_csv_cols: Identified using std_vrs_map.keys(). These are the columns for "English_verses", "Vulgate_verses", etc.
project_csv_cols: Derived by taking all *_verses columns from the DataFrame and removing the standard ones.
Error Handling & Logging: Enhanced to cover new scenarios like failing to load a pre-existing CSV.
Consistency:
CAN_IMPORT_VERSE_REF is used consistently for machine.scripture imports.
Versification.load(vrs_file, name=project_name) is used for loading project VRS files to ensure the name attribute of the Versification object is set correctly, which is then used as the column header.
How to Run the New Script:

(Assuming you've renamed the file to update_versifications.py)

Generate CSV and Update Settings (Default):
bash
poetry run python update_versifications.py
Only Generate CSV:
bash
poetry run python update_versifications.py --skip_settings_update
Only Update Settings (assuming compare_versifications.csv already exists):
bash
poetry run python update_versifications.py --skip_csv_generation
Dry Run for Settings Update (Generate CSV then dry run update):
bash
poetry run python update_versifications.py --dry_run
Dry Run for Settings Update (using existing CSV):
bash
poetry run python update_versifications.py --skip_csv_generation --dry_run

I get this error when I run with the --dry-run option

It sounds like you're encountering an issue when using the --dry_run option. While the specific error message isn't provided, I've reviewed the update_versifications.py script, particularly how arguments are handled.

One area for improvement in code clarity and quality is within the generate_comparison_csv function. This function currently defines its own argparse.ArgumentParser instance and adds arguments to it. However, this local parser is never actually used to parse command-line arguments; the function receives an already-parsed args object from the main function. This local parser setup can be misleading and is redundant.

Removing this local parser and its associated default_paths call (as the defaults are handled by the main parser) will make the generate_comparison_csv function cleaner and more straightforward, as it will clearly rely only on the arguments passed to it.

Here's a diff with the suggested changes:

    """Generates the versification comparison CSV file."""

    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(

    # --- 1. Load/Parse all VRS files ---
    # Store loaded Versification objects: {source_name: Versification_object}
    all_loaded_versifications: Dict[str, Versification] = {}

Explanation of Changes:

Removed local ArgumentParser: The ArgumentParser instance created within generate_comparison_csv and its associated add_argument calls have been removed.
Removed local default_paths call: The line default_paths = get_default_paths() within generate_comparison_csv was removed because it was only used to provide default values to the now-removed local parser. The args object passed into this function from main will already have these paths correctly resolved based on command-line input or the defaults defined in main's parser.
These changes improve the script's clarity by ensuring that argument parsing is centralized in the main function, and other functions like generate_comparison_csv simply consume the parsed arguments passed to them.

If the error you're experiencing persists after this cleanup or is different, providing the specific error message would be very helpful for further diagnosis.

Here's the error. It is happening with the new code too.

Gemini
Ah, that TypeError is a classic sign of a type hinting feature being used with an older Python version!

The | operator for union types in type hints (like pd.DataFrame | None) was officially introduced in Python 3.10. If your environment is running Python 3.9 or earlier, it won't understand this syntax, leading to the TypeError when the script is parsed.

The fix is to use the typing.Optional for this specific case, or typing.Union for more general unions, which are compatible with older Python versions.

Updated Return Type: Changed the return type annotation of generate_comparison_csv:

This change should resolve the TypeError and allow your script to run correctly on Python versions older than 3.10. Give it a try with the --dry-run option again!

The previous code compare_versifications.py worked correctly for updating the compare_versifications.csv file. This code does add the standard versifications, but omits all of the project versifications from that file. Then there are no projects to update:

Gemini
You've correctly identified the issue! The logic for distinguishing between "standard" (built-in) versifications and "project" versifications in the update_versification_settings function seems to have a flaw that results in project_csv_cols being empty.

Let's look at how these are determined in update_versification_settings:

standard_vrs_csv_cols is built from std_vrs_map.keys(). The std_vrs_map is populated by iterating through VersificationType and getting vrs_obj.name from Versification.get_builtin(vtype). This part seems correct for identifying standard versification names like "English", "Vulgate", etc.

project_csv_cols is then derived by taking all_verses_cols (all columns ending in _verses from the DataFrame) and removing standard_vrs_csv_cols.

The problem likely lies in how the all_loaded_versifications dictionary (and subsequently the DataFrame column names) are populated in generate_comparison_csv versus how standard_vrs_csv_cols is created.

In generate_comparison_csv:

Built-in versifications are added to all_loaded_versifications using vrs_obj.name as the key (e.g., "English").
Project-specific VRS files are loaded, and Versification.load(vrs_file, name=project_name) is used. This means the key in all_loaded_versifications for a project like "aai" will be "aai".
The column names in the DataFrame become f"{source_name}_verses", so we'd have "English_verses", "Vulgate_verses", "aai_verses", etc.

In update_versification_settings:

standard_vrs_csv_cols becomes ["English_verses", "Vulgate_verses", ...].
all_verses_cols correctly contains all *_verses columns: ["English_verses", "Vulgate_verses", ..., "aai_verses", ...].
The line project_csv_cols = [col for col in all_verses_cols if col not in standard_vrs_csv_cols] should then correctly identify ["aai_verses", ...] as project columns.
The most likely culprit is a subtle mismatch or an issue in how the df.columns are being handled or how the list comprehensions are interacting.

Let's re-examine the logic in update_versification_settings for identifying project columns.

The current logic:

python
    # Standard versification columns in the CSV (e.g., "English_verses")
    # These names come from Versification.get_builtin(vtype).name
    standard_vrs_csv_cols = [f"{name}_verses" for name in std_vrs_map.keys() if f"{name}_verses" in df.columns]
    logger.info(f"Found standard versification columns for scoring: {standard_vrs_csv_cols}")

    # Project columns are all other "*_verses" columns
    all_verses_cols = [col for col in df.columns if col.endswith("_verses")]
    project_csv_cols = [col for col in all_verses_cols if col not in standard_vrs_csv_cols]
    
    logger.info(f"Found {len(project_csv_cols)} project columns in CSV to process for settings update.")
This logic appears sound. If standard_vrs_csv_cols correctly contains only the standard ones, then the set difference should yield the project ones.

Could there be an issue with std_vrs_map.keys() not perfectly matching the names used when Versification.get_builtin(vtype) was called during CSV generation? The vrs_obj.name should be consistent.

Let's add some debug logging to update_versification_settings to see the contents of these lists right before project_csv_cols is calculated. This will help pinpoint where the discrepancy arises.

update_versifications.py
-1
+5
    # Standard versification columns in the CSV (e.g., "English_verses")
    # These names come from Versification.get_builtin(vtype).name
    standard_vrs_csv_cols = [f"{name}_verses" for name in std_vrs_map.keys() if f"{name}_verses" in df.columns]
    logger.info(f"Found standard versification columns for scoring: {standard_vrs_csv_cols}")
    logger.debug(f"std_vrs_map.keys(): {list(std_vrs_map.keys())}")
    logger.info(f"Identified standard versification CSV columns for scoring: {standard_vrs_csv_cols}")

    # Project columns are all other "*_verses" columns
    all_verses_cols = [col for col in df.columns if col.endswith("_verses")]
    logger.debug(f"All '*_verses' columns from DataFrame: {all_verses_cols}")
    logger.debug(f"DataFrame columns: {df.columns.tolist()}")

    project_csv_cols = [col for col in all_verses_cols if col not in standard_vrs_csv_cols]
    
    logger.info(f"Found {len(project_csv_cols)} project columns in CSV to process for settings update.")

After adding this logging, run your script again (e.g., poetry run python ebible_code/update_versifications.py --dry-run). The output from these new logger.debug lines will be crucial:

std_vrs_map.keys(): Shows the names derived directly from VersificationType.
Identified standard versification CSV columns...: Shows which of those (with _verses appended) were actually found in the DataFrame.
All '*_verses' columns from DataFrame...: Shows all columns in the DataFrame that end with _verses.
DataFrame columns...: Shows all columns in the DataFrame, just to be absolutely sure.
Compare list #2 and list #3. If list #2 (standard columns found in DF) somehow includes all the _verses columns from list #3, then project_csv_cols would indeed be empty. This would imply that project-specific versification names (like "aai") are mistakenly ending up in std_vrs_map.keys() or that the if f"{name}_verses" in df.columns check is behaving unexpectedly.

The most common reason for such behavior would be if Versification.get_builtin(vtype) could somehow return a Versification object whose .name attribute matches a project ID. This seems unlikely for the standard VersificationType enum values.

Let's consider the generate_comparison_csv part where source_names_ordered is created:

python
    if CAN_IMPORT_VERSE_REF:
        # The order of builtin_vrs_source_names is already based on VersificationType enum order
        # common_vrs_ordered_names = builtin_vrs_source_names # This is already set
        
        # Project VRS files are those not in the builtin_vrs_source_names list
        project_vrs_names = sorted([
            name for name in all_loaded_versifications.keys() if name not in builtin_vrs_source_names
        ])
        source_names_ordered = builtin_vrs_source_names + project_vrs_names
Here, builtin_vrs_source_names contains names like "English", "Vulgate". all_loaded_versifications.keys() contains "English", "Vulgate", ..., "aai", "aak", etc. So, project_vrs_names should correctly become ["aai", "aak", ...]. And source_names_ordered will be ["Original", "Septuagint", ..., "aai", "aak", ...]. The columns in the CSV will then be Original_verses, Septuagint_verses, ..., aai_verses, aak_verses.

This part seems correct. The issue is almost certainly in how standard_vrs_csv_cols is being populated or used in update_versification_settings.

The debug logs you'll get from the change above should illuminate the exact contents of these lists and help us see why the project columns are being filtered out.

One small thought: Is it possible that one of your project IDs (e.g., "aai") coincidentally matches a name that Versification.get_builtin(vtype).name could produce for some VersificationType? This is highly unlikely but worth keeping in the back of your mind when looking at the debug output of std_vrs_map.keys().

After you run with the added logging, please share the relevant log output. That will give us the concrete data needed to fix the filter.

Gemini
You've found the culprit! The error message Failed to load project VRS file ...: load() got an unexpected keyword argument 'name' clearly points to an issue with how the Versification.load() method is being called for project-specific VRS files.

It seems that when we integrated the code, the argument for providing a name to the Versification object if it can't be determined from the file was changed from fallback_name (which was used in the original compare_versifications.py and worked) to name. The sil-machine library's Versification.load() method evidently expects fallback_name.

Let's revert that specific keyword argument back to fallback_name.

Here's the diff:

update_versifications.py
-1
+1
        logger.info(f"Parsing project VRS: {vrs_file.name} (for project '{project_name}')")
        try:
            # Use project_name as the Versification object's name
            loaded_vrs = Versification.load(vrs_file, name=project_name) # Use name instead of fallback_name
            loaded_vrs = Versification.load(vrs_file, fallback_name=project_name) # Reverted to fallback_name
            all_loaded_versifications[project_name] = loaded_vrs
        except Exception as e:
            logger.error(f"Failed to load project VRS file {vrs_file.name} for project {project_name}: {e}")

Explanation of Change:

In the generate_comparison_csv function, within the loop that processes project-specific VRS files, the line: loaded_vrs = Versification.load(vrs_file, name=project_name) has been changed back to: loaded_vrs = Versification.load(vrs_file, fallback_name=project_name)
This aligns the call with the expected arguments of the Versification.load() method from the sil-machine library, which should resolve the TypeError and allow the project VRS files to be loaded correctly. This, in turn, should ensure that project versifications are included in the compare_versifications.csv file and are available for the settings update phase.

I'd like to get the code to output the list of scores for each versification comparison. That will help to see which are clearly one not the other and which are doubtfull. It should also help with the setting of good weights.

Could we have the code output another csv file comparison.results.csv. That would have a Project column, then a column for each versification. The project name (i.e. folder name) would go in the first column, and the score for each versification would go in the other columns.

We could include the weights in the filename, so that subsequent runs with different weights are in different files. I wonder whether there's a neater solution though. Perhaps vrs_comp_B{WEIGHIT_BOOK}_C{WEIGHT_CHAPTER}_V{WEIGHT_VERSE}.csv would work.


Gemini
Okay, that's a great idea! Outputting the detailed scores for each project against every standard versification will be very insightful for fine-tuning the weights and understanding the nuances of each comparison. Generating a separate CSV for these results, with filenames reflecting the weights used, is a solid approach.

Here's how we can modify the update_versifications.py script to achieve this:

Collect all scores: In the update_versification_settings function, we'll gather all calculated scores for each project into a list of dictionaries.
Generate dynamic filename: Create a filename for the scores CSV that includes the current weight settings.
Write scores to CSV: Add a new function or logic at the end of update_versification_settings to write this collected data to the new CSV file.

Key Changes:

update_versification_settings Function:
all_projects_scores_data = []: Initializes a list to hold the score data for each project.
standard_versification_names_for_scores_csv = sorted(list(std_vrs_map.keys())): Gets a sorted list of standard versification names. This will be used to ensure consistent column ordering in the output CSV.
Inside the project loop:
current_project_scores = {"Project": project_id}: A dictionary is created for the current project's scores.
current_project_scores[std_vrs_name_key] = round(current_score, 4): The calculated score for each standard versification is stored.
After iterating through all standard versifications for a project, a loop ensures that current_project_scores has an entry for every standard versification (defaulting to 0.0 if a score wasn't explicitly calculated, e.g., if the standard versification had no data). This ensures all rows in the CSV have the same set of columns.
all_projects_scores_data.append(current_project_scores): The completed scores dictionary for the project is added to the main list.
Writing Scores CSV:
At the end of update_versification_settings, after processing all projects:
A filename is constructed: versification_scores_B{WEIGHT_BOOK}_C{WEIGHT_CHAPTER}_V{WEIGHT_VERSE_COUNT}.csv.
The weight values are formatted to be filename-friendly (integers if they are whole numbers, otherwise replacing . with _ for floats).
The path for this new CSV is set to be in the same directory as compare_versifications.csv (i.e., args.csv_file.parent).
A pandas DataFrame is created from all_projects_scores_data.
The columns of the DataFrame are reordered to have "Project" first, followed by the standard versification names in alphabetical order.
The DataFrame is written to the new CSV file, with float scores formatted to 4 decimal places.
To use this:

When you run the script, for example: poetry run python ebible_code/update_versifications.py --dry-run

If your weights are WEIGHT_BOOK = 2.0, WEIGHT_CHAPTER = 1.0, WEIGHT_VERSE_COUNT = 2.5, it will now:

Generate/update EBIBLE_DATA_DIR/metadata/compare_versifications.csv.
Perform the dry run for Settings.xml updates.
Generate a new file: EBIBLE_DATA_DIR/metadata/versification_scores_B2_C1_V2_5.csv.
This new CSV will look something like this:

csv
Project,English,Original,Russian Orthodox,Russian Protestant,Septuagint,Vulgate
aai,0.8523,0.7500,0.8400,0.8523,0.7000,0.7200
aak,0.9100,0.8000,0.9000,0.9100,0.7800,0.7900
...
This should give you exactly the data you need to analyze the scoring and refine your weights!

This seems to be working very well.
In the logic for comparing versifications to the standard, we are only comparing differences in the presence or absence of Books and Chapters, and the total length of each chapter. There are very small differences in the scores for each project, so the 'signal' isn't very clear. For most of the chapters the number of verses is the same across all the standard versification systems. Could we ignore all the chapters whose lengths are the same in all the versification systems, and consider only those that differ between systems. That would require an initial calculation to discard those chapters that are the same in all versification systems. Perhaps we can use that to speed up processing too, because fewer chapters would need to be considered. Hopefully this will also increase the variance in the scores, making it clearer which is the most likely candidate.


Gemini
You're right, focusing the comparison on the chapters where standard versification systems actually differ should indeed provide a clearer signal and highlight more meaningful distinctions. This is an excellent refinement to the heuristic!

Here's how we can implement this:

Identify "Invariant Chapters": Before scoring any project, we'll analyze all standard versifications to find chapters where their verse counts are identical (or where only one standard system defines the chapter, making it non-differentiating among multiple systems). These will be our "invariant chapters."
Modify Scoring Logic: The calculate_similarity_score function will be updated.
The Book Score will remain as is, considering the overall presence of books.
The Chapter Score and Verse Count Score will now focus only on the "differentiating" (i.e., non-invariant) chapters that are present in the common books between the project and the standard.
This approach should amplify the differences where they matter most for distinguishing between standard versification systems.

Summary of Changes:

update_versification_settings():

Added a new section to identify invariant_chapters.
It first loads verse data for all standard versifications.
Then, it iterates through all unique (Book, Chapter) pairs found across these standards.
For each pair, it collects the verse counts from all standard versifications that define that chapter.
If there's 0 or 1 unique verse count among these definitions, the chapter is marked as invariant.
The invariant_chapters set is then passed to calculate_similarity_score.
calculate_similarity_score():

Now accepts invariant_chapters: Set[Tuple[str, int]] as a new parameter.
Book Score: Calculated as before, based on the overall intersection of books between the project and the standard.
Focused Comparison Data:
project_bc_for_detailed_comparison: Contains (Book, Chapter) pairs from the project that are within common_books AND are not in invariant_chapters.
standard_bc_for_detailed_comparison: Similarly, (Book, Chapter) pairs from the standard that are within common_books AND are not in invariant_chapters.
Chapter Score:
Numerator: Intersection of project_bc_for_detailed_comparison and standard_bc_for_detailed_comparison (i.e., common differentiating chapters).
Denominator: Total number of chapters in project_bc_for_detailed_comparison.
Verse Count Score:
Calculated based on the common_differentiating_chapters.
Numerator: Number of these common differentiating chapters where verse counts match.
Denominator: Total number of common_differentiating_chapters.
The final weighted score is computed using these refined component scores.
Impact and Considerations:

Increased Variance: This change should indeed increase the variance in scores, as you hypothesized. Similarities in invariant chapters will no longer dilute the scores, allowing the differences in variant chapters to have a more pronounced effect.
Weight Re-evaluation: The current weights (WEIGHT_BOOK = 0.0, WEIGHT_CHAPTER = 0.0, WEIGHT_VERSE_COUNT = 1.0) will now make the WEIGHT_VERSE_COUNT (and WEIGHT_CHAPTER if it were non-zero) apply to a more targeted and potentially smaller set of chapters. You'll likely want to experiment with these weights again (e.g., 2.0, 1.0, 2.5 or 1.0, 1.0, 1.0) to see what yields the most intuitive results with this new scoring logic.
Speed: The initial calculation to find invariant chapters adds a bit of overhead, but the subsequent scoring for each project might be slightly faster if many chapters are invariant, as the dictionaries being intersected for chapter and verse scores will be smaller. The overall impact on speed should be minimal or potentially slightly positive.
Logging: I've added some commented-out logger.debug lines within calculate_similarity_score and for invariant chapters. You can uncomment these if you want very detailed output during testing to understand how the scores are being derived with the new logic.
This refined approach should make the versification comparison more sensitive to the actual distinguishing features between the standard systems.

I got this error: C:\ebible_code>poetry run python ebible_code/update_versifications.py File "C:\ebible_code\ebible_code\update_versifications.py", line 144 invariant_chapters: Set[Tuple[str, int]]

It looks like there's a small syntax error in the function definition for calculate_similarity_score. You're missing a comma between the standard_v_data parameter and the invariant_chapters parameter.

Here's the corrected line:

update_versifications.py
-1
+1

def calculate_similarity_score(
    project_v_data: Dict[tuple, int], 
    standard_v_data: Dict[tuple, int]
    standard_v_data: Dict[tuple, int],
    invariant_chapters: Set[Tuple[str, int]]
    ) -> float:
    """Calculates the similarity score.

Adding that comma should resolve the SyntaxError you're encountering!
