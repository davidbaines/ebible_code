There are several things that I would like to work on for this repo.

The main aim of the repo is to produce a parallel dataset for machine learning from the Bibles available for downloading from eBible.org.

The code uses SILNLP and the machine library to do this and there are several steps involved:

Download the translations.csv file from ebible.org to find the list of translations.
Create ebible_status.csv with the information from the translations.csv as a starting point. This file keeps track of the progress of each translation through the 'pipeline'.
Download the zipped translations and unzip them.
Can you continue this list from the logic of the code in ebible.py This could be used to check and maybe update README.md


Gemini
Okay, I can help continue that list based on the workflow in ebible.py. This detailed breakdown should indeed be useful for checking and potentially updating your README.md.

Here's a continuation of your list, detailing the subsequent steps:

Your initial steps:

Download the translations.csv file from ebible.org to find the list of translations.
Create ebible_status.csv (if it doesn't exist) by initializing it with information from translations.csv. This status file is subsequently loaded and updated to track the progress and state of each translation through the pipeline.
Download the zipped USFM Bible translations from ebible.org and unzip them into their respective project folders (e.g., in projects/ or private_projects/).
Continuing the list based on ebible.py logic:

Prepare Individual Project Folders (First Major Pass of ebible.py): For each newly unzipped or reprocessed translation, the script performs several setup tasks within its project folder: a. Rename USFM Files: It standardizes the names of the USFM files (e.g., A01OSPSFM.usfm might become 01GEN.SFM or a similar convention, according to the logic in rename_usfm.py) to ensure consistency for subsequent processing. b. Generate Versification (.vrs) File: A project-specific versification file (e.g., <translationId>.vrs) is generated. This file is created by analyzing the USFM content to determine the Bible's versification scheme. c. Create Settings.xml: A Settings.xml file is written into the project directory. This configuration file includes important metadata for SIL tools, such as the language code and, crucially, the inferred versification system (which references the .vrs file generated in the previous step). d. Extract License Information: The script parses the copr.htm file (typically found within the unzipped translation archive) to extract copyright statements, Creative Commons license details (if any), and other related metadata. This extracted information is then saved into the corresponding row for the translation in ebible_status.csv.

Text Extraction using SILNLP (Manual Intermediary Step): After the project folders are prepared, ebible.py prints out the necessary commands for the user to run the bulk_extract_corpora.py script, which is part of the SILNLP toolkit. This external script is responsible for:

Iterating through the prepared project folders.
Extracting the actual verse text from the USFM files.
Saving this text into plain text files, usually one verse per line. These output files are typically placed in the corpus/ (for public data) or private_corpus/ (for private data) directories and are named by SILNLP in a format like languageCode-translationId.txt (e.g., eng-KJV.txt).
Finalize Extracted Files and Update Status (Second Major Pass/Run of ebible.py): Once the SILNLP bulk_extract_corpora.py script has completed, ebible.py is run again (or this part of its logic is executed if it's processing files from a previous SILNLP run). This pass focuses on the files generated by SILNLP: a. Rename Extracted Text Files: The script scans the corpus/ and private_corpus/ directories for the text files output by SILNLP. It then renames these files from SILNLP's default naming convention (e.g., eng-KJV.txt or aai-aai.txt) to the project's final standard format, which is translationId.txt (e.g., KJV.txt, aai.txt). b. Update Status with Final Paths: The paths to these newly renamed text files, along with the date of renaming, are recorded in ebible_status.csv. This marks the successful extraction and finalization of the text data for a translation.

Ongoing Status Management and Error Tracking: Throughout all these stages, ebible_status.csv serves as the central ledger. It's continuously updated to reflect:

Dates of various operations (download, unzip, license check, settings file creation, text file renaming).
Paths to downloaded zip files, unzipped project folders, and final extracted text files.
Key extracted metadata like license details and inferred versification.
Any errors encountered during the processing of a specific translation, which helps in debugging and allows the script to skip previously failed items on subsequent runs. This status file is crucial for the script's ability to resume processing, avoid redundant work, and manage the complex workflow across many translations.
Special Operational Mode - Update Settings (--update-settings): ebible.py includes a special mode triggered by the --update-settings command-line flag. When run in this mode:

It bypasses the download, unzip, and full processing pipeline.
Instead, it iterates through all existing project folders (both public and private).
For each project, it regenerates the Settings.xml file (and the associated project-specific .vrs file if it's missing or needs an update). This is useful for applying new logic for versification scoring or other settings changes across all previously processed translations.
It updates ebible_status.csv with the new settings file date and any changed versification information.
A report detailing the changes made to settings files (settings_update.csv) is generated.
The script then prints the SILNLP commands and exits.
Regarding README.md:

This detailed list can indeed help you check and update your README.md. Here are a few thoughts:

"Regenerating the corpus" section: Your current README describes a multi-step process involving two runs of ebible.py sandwiching the SILNLP step. The list above provides a more granular breakdown of what happens in each of those ebible.py passes. You could integrate this more detailed sequence there.

"What the script does" section: This section in your README is currently quite high-level:

downloads a translations.csv file which outlines the currently available translations (in metadata dir)
downloads zip files for each translation (in downloads dir)
unpacks those zip files into paratext projects (in projects dir)
constructs a licence file (in metadata dir)
The list above expands significantly on these points.
Correction needed: The last point, "constructs a licence file (in metadata dir)," is slightly misleading. The script extracts license information from copr.htm within each project and stores this data within the ebible_status.csv file (which itself resides in the metadata directory). It doesn't create a separate, standalone "licence file" in the metadata directory for all licenses. Step 4d in the list above clarifies this. You might want to update this in the README for accuracy.
Clarity on File Naming: The README correctly explains the initial SILNLP naming (<languageCode>-<translationId>.txt) and the final naming (<translationId>.txt). Step 6a in the list above reiterates this renaming step performed by ebible.py.

By incorporating these details, you can provide users with a clearer and more comprehensive understanding of the entire data generation pipeline.

I would like to have the ebible code manage the extraction itself. This will greatly ease the use of the script and will also allow the script to know where it is in the processing of each translation.

I have full access to all the code necessary and the machine library is already available to the code. You can see the code that is used to extract a single project in extract_corpora.py This is copied from the SILNLP code. I hope this gives information that would allow us to effectively reproduce that within the ebible.py code, and call it for each project that needs to be extracted into a corpus text.

Can you identifiy concerns or difficulties with this idea? Are there more scripts from SILNLP or the machine library that would be helpful to examine in order to accomplish this goal? Are there other questions or ambiguites that should be resolved before starting on changes to ebible.py ?


Gemini
That's an excellent goal! Integrating the extraction directly into ebible.py will indeed streamline the workflow significantly and give you better control and insight into the process for each translation.

Based on the provided ebible.py and assets/extract_corpora.py, here's an analysis of your idea:

Concerns and Difficulties with Integration:
Dependency on assets/paratext.py:

The provided assets/extract_corpora.py heavily relies on functions imported from an assets/paratext.py file (e.g., extract_project, check_versification, extract_term_renderings). The logic within assets/paratext.py will be central to the success of this integration. ebible.py will effectively be calling functions from this module.
Error Handling and Propagation:

The extract_project function (from assets/paratext.py) needs a robust way to signal success or failure. Currently, assets/extract_corpora.py logs errors but doesn't have a clear return mechanism for ebible.py to catch specific errors from the extraction of a single project.
ebible.py will need to catch these errors, log them in ebible_status.csv (e.g., in status_last_error), and potentially mark the translation to be skipped in future runs, similar to how download/unzip errors are handled.
Configuration and Parameter Passing:

assets/extract_corpora.py takes several command-line arguments (--include, --exclude, --markers, --lemmas, --project-vrefs) that are passed to extract_project. ebible.py will need to:
Decide on default values for these (e.g., extract all books, no special markers for a general parallel corpus).
Potentially add new command-line arguments to ebible.py if you want to control these extraction options per run.
The extract_project function will need to accept the target output directory (e.g., corpus_folder or private_corpus_folder from ebible.py) instead of relying on SIL_NLP_ENV.mt_scripture_dir.
Path Management (SIL_NLP_ENV vs. ebible.py's system):

assets/extract_corpora.py uses SIL_NLP_ENV for paths like SIL_NLP_ENV.assets_dir / "vref.txt" and output directories. ebible.py has its own path management based on EBIBLE_DATA_DIR.
The functions from assets/paratext.py will need to be adapted or called in a way that uses ebible.py's path conventions. For instance, the path to vref.txt (if get_expected_verse_count is used) will need to be resolved correctly.
Output Filename Control:

extract_project returns a corpus_filename. ebible.py currently has a rename_extracted_files function that expects SILNLP's bulk_extract_corpora.py to produce files named like <languageCode>-<translationId>.txt.
Ideally, the integrated extract_project function should either:
Allow ebible.py to specify the output filename directly (e.g., to <languageCode>-<translationId>.txt or even the final <translationId>.txt).
Or, its output naming convention must be clearly understood by ebible.py so that status_extract_original_filename can be correctly populated and rename_extracted_files can work.
Role of check_versification:

ebible.py already goes to great lengths to determine the correct versification and write it into Settings.xml (via settings_file.py).
The check_versification(project_dir) call (from assets/paratext.py) in assets/extract_corpora.py needs clarification. It should ideally use the Settings.xml created by ebible.py as the source of truth for versification during extraction, rather than trying to re-determine or validate it in a conflicting way. If it's purely a validation step, its outcome needs to be handled.
Necessity of Term Renderings:

assets/extract_corpora.py also calls extract_term_renderings. Your main aim is a "parallel dataset" of verses. If these term renderings are not essential for that goal, omitting this step during integration would simplify things.
Validation of Extracted Content:

assets/extract_corpora.py includes get_expected_verse_count and compares the actual extracted verse count. This is a valuable validation. ebible.py could incorporate this, logging warnings or errors if counts don't match expectations.
More Scripts/Modules to Examine:
assets/paratext.py (Crucial):

This is the most important piece of code to understand. The implementations of extract_project, check_versification, and extract_term_renderings will dictate how they are called and what they return.
extract_project(...):
How does it iterate through the USFM files in a project? (Likely using machine.corpora.ParatextTextCorpus).
How does it handle different versifications (it should use the Settings.xml)?
How does it format the output text (one verse per line)?
What are its exact error conditions?
machine.corpora.ParatextTextCorpus:

Both ebible.py (via settings_file.py for generating project-specific .vrs files) and assets/extract_corpora.py (likely via assets/paratext.py) will use this or similar logic to read Paratext projects. Ensuring consistent usage and understanding its behavior with Settings.xml is important.
machine.scripture module (VerseRef, Versification, Canon):

These are fundamental for handling Bible references. ebible.py and the extraction logic must use them consistently.
Other Questions and Ambiguities to Resolve Before Starting:
Deep Dive into assets/paratext.py:

What are the precise signatures (parameters, return types) of extract_project, check_versification, and extract_term_renderings?
How does extract_project determine the output filename if not explicitly told?
What specific exceptions can extract_project raise that ebible.py should handle?
Extraction Options (--include, --exclude, etc.):

For the primary goal of a parallel dataset, what should be the default behavior for book inclusion/exclusion, inclusion of markers, lemmas, or project-specific vrefs?
Will these options need to be configurable via ebible.py's command line, or can they be hardcoded to sensible defaults for this project? (e.g., include all canonical books, no markers, no lemmas).
Definition of "Parallel Dataset" Scope:

Are term renderings strictly necessary? (Likely no, for a verse-aligned parallel corpus).
Are lemmas or USFM markers desired in the final text output?
Integration of check_versification:

If ebible.py has already created Settings.xml with a chosen versification, what is the exact purpose of check_versification from assets/paratext.py? Is it a pre-flight check, a validation, or does it modify settings? It should not conflict with ebible.py's settings generation.
Workflow Modification in ebible.py:

The current multi-pass approach (prepare, then manual SILNLP, then rename) will change.
A likely new flow per translation inside ebible.py's main loop:
Download/Unzip (as is).
Prepare project folder (rename USFM, generate .vrs, write Settings.xml, extract license) (as is).
Call integrated extraction function (e.g., a wrapper around extract_project).
If extraction successful, get the output path.
Rename the extracted file if the integrated function doesn't output to the final desired name (<translationId>.txt).
Update ebible_status.csv with extraction path, date, and clear errors.
If extraction fails, update ebible_status.csv with the error.
Idempotency of Extraction:

If ebible.py is run again, and a translation's text file already exists and is up-to-date (based on status_extract_renamed_date and max_age_days), the extraction step should be skipped, similar to downloads and unzips. The determine_actions logic will need to be extended to include an action_needed_extract.
In summary:

Yes, this is a very good idea and achievable. The main challenge will be understanding and cleanly integrating the logic from assets/paratext.py (especially extract_project) into ebible.py's existing framework, paying close attention to path management, error handling, and configuration. The assets/extract_corpora.py script provides a good template for how extract_project is used.

You would essentially be creating a new function in ebible.py, say extract_text_for_project(project_row, project_path, output_corpus_dir), which would internally call the necessary functions (primarily extract_project from assets/paratext.py after setting up paths and parameters).

Please note that the code in the assets folder is given so that you can see how it works.

ebible.py should not refer to code that is in the assets folder, but will import functions from the machine library. Perhaps the extract_project code from the paratext.py will need to tbe reproduced in ebible.py.

Yes the error handling will need to be able to signal success or failure. That could be a check of whether the expected extract file exists and contains data. Those should be stored in ebible_status.csv

For our purposes we can ignore most of the command-line arguments that can be passed to extract_corpora. We will extract all books so --include and --exclude are not required by our code. neither are --lemmas or --project-vrefs. The corpus folder will be the target folder for all the redistributable projects and the private_corpus folder will be the target for all those in the private_projects folder. These can be listed explicitly in the .env file perhaps to keep as many constants as possible in one place. The SIL_NLP_ENV are used by SILNLP, but that is just provided as code to make use of. We will not be using SIL_NLP_ENV.

Yes, it would be ideal if the extract_project could specify the output_filename and avoid the need for any renaming. I'm not sure how the current renaming is working, but keeping flexibility within the code to make it easy to adjust the naming of the corpus files will be very helpful.

If the filenames no longer need renaming, then the columns in ebible_status.csv related to that will no longer be required. The output filename returned by extract_project should be very useful to the ebible.py code. It means that the "status_extract_path" and "status_extract_date" can be saved in the ebible_status.csv in a column without any reliance on the human operator. Since the status_extract_path contains the original extracted filename we can omit the status_extract_original_filename column from the ebible_status.csv. It is duplicated data.

The renaming of the corpus file can also be done by the code immediately after extraction, and that information saved in the ebible_status.csv

Okay, this is a significant and beneficial change to streamline your data processing pipeline! Integrating the text extraction directly into ebible.py will make it much more self-contained and easier to manage.

Here's a breakdown of the plan and the suggested code changes:

Core Idea:

Internal Extraction Function: We'll create a new helper function within ebible.py (e.g., _perform_text_extraction_for_project) that replicates the core logic of assets/paratext.py extract_project using components from the machine.corpora library. This function will take a prepared project directory and an output path, and write the extracted text directly to the final desired filename (e.g., KJV.txt).
Workflow Integration: This new function will be called from ebible.py's main processing loop for each translation that requires extraction.
Status File Simplification: The ebible_status.csv columns related to the intermediate SILNLP output and subsequent renaming will be simplified.
Removal of External Steps: The manual step of running bulk_extract_corpora.py and the ebible.py logic for renaming its output will no longer be necessary.
Benefits:

Simplified Workflow: No more multi-step execution involving external scripts for extraction.
Better State Tracking: ebible.py will have direct knowledge of the extraction status for each translation.
Reduced Complexity: Fewer scripts and intermediate file-naming conventions to manage.
Let's go through the suggested code modifications.

1. New Internal Extraction Function
We'll add this helper function to ebible.py. It leverages machine.corpora utilities.

python
# Add this function to ebible.py, for example, after the scanning functions.
# Ensure necessary imports are at the top of ebible.py:

# from contextlib import ExitStack (if not already imported for other purposes)

    try:
        # ParatextTextCorpus uses Settings.xml within project_dir_path for versification.
        # include_markers=False is the default for typical parallel corpus text.
        project_corpus = ParatextTextCorpus(str(project_dir_path), include_markers=False)
        
        # ref_corpus is based on the standard vref.txt that machine.corpora knows.
        # This ensures alignment to a common verse reference scheme.
        ref_corpus = create_versification_ref_corpus()

        # The user wants all books, so no filtering logic for include_books/exclude_books is applied here.

        segment_count = 0
        # extract_scripture_corpus is a context manager.
        with output_file_path.open("w", encoding="utf-8", newline="\n") as output_stream, \

            for line_content, _ref_vref, _project_vref in output_lines_iterator:
                output_stream.write(line_content + "\n")
                segment_count += 1
        
        if segment_count == 0:
            # This could be an error or just an empty source.

            logging.warning(f"Extraction for {translation_id} resulted in 0 segments. Output file {output_file_path} created but is empty.")
            # If an empty file is considered an error, you could return:
            # return False, "No segments extracted from project", 0

        logger.info(f"Successfully extracted {segment_count} segments for {translation_id} to {output_file_path}")
        return True, None, segment_count

    except Exception as e:
        logger.error(f"Error during text extraction for {translation_id} from {project_dir_path} to {output_file_path}: {e}", exc_info=True)

3. Review README.md
Your README.md will need updates to reflect these changes:

Remove references to the manual SILNLP bulk_extract_corpora.py step. The extraction is now internal.
Update the "What the ebible script does" / Workflow section:
The step "Text Extraction using SILNLP (Manual Intermediary Step)" should be removed/replaced.
The "Finalize Extracted Files and Update Status (Second Major Pass/Run of ebible.py)" is now integrated. The renaming part is gone if the internal extraction writes to the final filename directly.
The description of file naming by SILNLP (<languageCode>-<translationId>.txt) is no longer relevant as an intermediate step visible to the user. The script will directly aim for <translationId>.txt.
File Naming Convention: Clarify that ebible.py now directly produces <translationId>.txt.
ebible_status.csv columns: If you update the README to list columns, reflect the changes (removal of status_extract_renamed_date and status_extract_original_filename, and the new meaning of status_extract_date).
Example README Snippet Change (Conceptual):

Old (Conceptual from your README):

Text Extraction using SILNLP (Manual Intermediary Step): After the project folders are prepared, ebible.py prints out the necessary commands for the user to run the bulk_extract_corpora.py script... ... Finalize Extracted Files and Update Status (Second Major Pass/Run of ebible.py): Once the SILNLP bulk_extract_corpora.py script has completed, ebible.py is run again... This pass focuses on the files generated by SILNLP: a. Rename Extracted Text Files...

New (Conceptual):

Integrated Text Extraction: After preparing the project folders (USFM renaming, Settings.xml creation, license extraction), ebible.py internally extracts the verse text from the USFM files. It uses functionalities similar to those in SILNLP, leveraging the machine library. The extracted text is saved directly into plain text files (one verse per line) in the corpus/ (for public data) or private_corpus/ (for private data) directories. The files are named using the final convention: <translationId>.txt (e.g., KJV.txt, aai.txt). The status of this extraction, including the path to the final text file and the date of extraction, is recorded in ebible_status.csv.

This is a substantial refactoring, but it significantly improves the robustness and usability of your script. Remember to test thoroughly, especially with existing ebible_status.csv files to ensure the column migration/handling works as expected.

Can we call the new function extract_project as in paratext.py - I think that will help me to see the connection between the two, though of course they are not identical.


Gemini
Okay, that's a good idea for clarity! Renaming _perform_text_extraction_for_project to extract_project in ebible.py will indeed make the connection to the logic in assets/paratext.py more apparent, even though the implementation details differ.

Here's the diff for c:\ebible_code\ebible_code\ebible.py with that change:

ebible.py
-3
+3
    return df


def _perform_text_extraction_for_project(
def extract_project( # Renamed from _perform_text_extraction_for_project
    project_dir_path: Path,
    output_file_path: Path,
    translation_id: str # For logging
) -> Tuple[bool, Optional[str], int]: # Returns: Success_flag, error_message, segment_count
) -> tuple[bool, Optional[str], int]: # Returns: Success_flag, error_message, segment_count
    """
    Extracts text from a Paratext project directory to a specified output file.
    Assumes Settings.xml is already present in project_dir_path.
        # Output filename is now directly the final name, e.g., KJV.txt
        output_file_path = target_corpus_folder / f"{translation_id}.txt"

        success, error_msg, _segment_count = _perform_text_extraction_for_project(
        success, error_msg, _segment_count = extract_project( # Call the renamed function
            project_dir_path, output_file_path, translation_id
        )


This change simply renames the function and updates its call site within extract_and_finalize_texts. The logic remains the same. This should help you trace the functionality more easily!

Can we clean that up a bit so that the detailled information like this is only shown if the log level is set to DEBUG?


Gemini
Okay, I can help you clean up that logging output!

You're right, those detailed "Extracting licence info..." and "Successfully extracted..." messages for each file can make the INFO level logs quite verbose when processing many translations. We can change those specific messages to logging.debug so they only appear when you explicitly set the log level to DEBUG. The overall progress and summary messages will remain at the INFO level.

Here's how we can adjust the get_and_update_licence_details function in your ebible.py script:

ebible.py
-2
+2
def get_and_update_licence_details(df: pd.DataFrame, index, project_dir: Path) -> pd.DataFrame:
    """Extracts licence details from copr.htm and updates the DataFrame row."""
    copyright_path = project_dir / "copr.htm"
    logging.info(f"Extracting licence info for {project_dir.name} from {copyright_path}")
    logging.debug(f"Extracting licence info for {project_dir.name} from {copyright_path}")

    # Clear previous licence data for this row first
    for col in LICENCE_COLUMNS:

        df.loc[index, 'licence_date_read'] = TODAY_STR
        df.loc[index, 'status_last_error'] = np.nan # Clear error on success
        logging.info(f"Successfully extracted licence info for {project_dir.name}")
        logging.debug(f"Successfully extracted licence info for {project_dir.name}")

    except Exception as e:
        logging.error(f"Error parsing licence file {copyright_path}: {e}")

Explanation of Changes:

logging.info(f"Extracting licence info for {project_dir.name} from {copyright_path}") has been changed to: logging.debug(f"Extracting licence info for {project_dir.name} from {copyright_path}")
logging.info(f"Successfully extracted licence info for {project_dir.name}") has been changed to: logging.debug(f"Successfully extracted licence info for {project_dir.name}")
With these changes:

When your script runs with the default INFO logging level, you will no longer see the individual "Extracting..." and "Successfully extracted..." lines for each license file.
You will still see the tqdm progress bar and the summary messages like "Performing licence check for X existing projects..." and "Finished separate licence check...".
If you need to see the detailed license extraction messages (for example, during debugging), you can change the root logger's level to logging.DEBUG (e.g., by modifying root_logger.setLevel(logging.INFO) to root_logger.setLevel(logging.DEBUG) temporarily, or by adding a command-line argument to control the log level).
This should make your console output much cleaner during normal operation while still providing the detailed information when needed!

Gemini
You're welcome! I'm glad the previous change helped clean up the logging.

Ah, that NameError is a classic scope issue! It seems when we created or refactored the extract_project function, we used logger.info and logger.error instead of the standard logging.info and logging.error that are used elsewhere in ebible.py.

The logger variable itself isn't defined within the local scope of the extract_project function, but the logging module (which is imported at the top of the script) is globally available.

Here's the fix to correct those calls:

ebible.py
-3
+3
    Extracts text from a Paratext project directory to a specified output file.
    Assumes Settings.xml is already present in project_dir_path.
    """
    logger.info(f"Starting text extraction for {translation_id} from {project_dir_path} to {output_file_path}")
    logging.info(f"Starting text extraction for {translation_id} from {project_dir_path} to {output_file_path}")
    try:
        # ParatextTextCorpus uses Settings.xml within project_dir_path for versification.
        # include_markers=False is the default for typical parallel corpus text.
        if segment_count == 0:
            logging.warning(f"Extraction for {translation_id} resulted in 0 segments. Output file {output_file_path} created but is empty.")

        logger.info(f"Successfully extracted {segment_count} segments for {translation_id} to {output_file_path}")
        logging.info(f"Successfully extracted {segment_count} segments for {translation_id} to {output_file_path}")
        return True, None, segment_count

    except Exception as e:
        logger.error(f"Error during text extraction for {translation_id} from {project_dir_path} to {output_file_path}: {e}", exc_info=True)
        logging.error(f"Error during text extraction for {translation_id} from {project_dir_path} to {output_file_path}: {e}", exc_info=True)
        if output_file_path.exists():
            try:
                output_file_path.unlink()

By changing logger.info to logging.info and logger.error to logging.error within the extract_project function, it will correctly use the imported logging module, resolving the NameError.

Could we tell tqdm to print the name of the project being extracted, along with the extract output file name, something like "Extracting project <project_folder> to file <extract_output_filepath>" along with the progress bar?


Gemini
Certainly! We can update the tqdm progress bar to display the name of the project and the output file it's currently working on. This will give you more context directly in the progress bar line.

We'll modify the extract_and_finalize_texts function in ebible.py. The tqdm instance will be assigned to a variable, and then we'll use its set_description_str() method to update the descriptive text dynamically within the loop.

Here's the suggested change:

ebible.py
-1
+16
    count = len(translations_to_extract)
    logging.info(f"Attempting to extract text for {count} projects...")

    extracted_count = 0
    for index, row in tqdm(translations_to_extract.iterrows(), total=count, desc="Extracting Text"):
    # Assign tqdm iterator to a variable to allow dynamic description updates
    pbar = tqdm(translations_to_extract.iterrows(), total=count, desc="Initializing extraction...")
    for index, row in pbar:
        translation_id = row['translationId']
        project_unzip_path_str = row['status_unzip_path']
        is_redist = row['Redistributable']

        # Default display names for tqdm, in case of early skip
        project_display_name = translation_id
        output_display_name = f"{translation_id}.txt (target)"

        if pd.isna(project_unzip_path_str):
            # Update description for skipped item
            pbar.set_description_str(f"Skipping {translation_id} (no unzip_path)")
            logging.warning(f"Skipping extraction for {translation_id}: No valid unzip path.")
            df.loc[index, 'status_last_error'] = "Extraction skipped: Missing unzip path"
            continue
        
        project_dir_path = Path(project_unzip_path_str)
        project_display_name = project_dir_path.name # Actual project folder name

        if not project_dir_path.is_dir():
            pbar.set_description_str(f"Skipping {project_display_name} (project dir not found)")
            logging.warning(f"Skipping extraction for {translation_id}: Project directory not found at {project_dir_path}.")
            df.loc[index, 'status_last_error'] = f"Extraction skipped: Project dir not found at {project_dir_path}"
            continue
        target_corpus_folder = corpus_folder if is_redist else private_corpus_folder
        # Output filename is now directly the final name, e.g., KJV.txt
        output_file_path = target_corpus_folder / f"{translation_id}.txt"
        output_display_name = output_file_path.name # Actual output file name

        # Set the description for the current item being actively processed
        pbar.set_description_str(f"Extracting {project_display_name} -> {output_display_name}")
        
        success, error_msg, _segment_count = extract_project( # Call the renamed function
            project_dir_path, output_file_path, translation_id
        )

Explanation of Changes:

pbar = tqdm(translations_to_extract.iterrows(), total=count, desc="Initializing extraction..."):

The tqdm object (which is an iterator) is now assigned to the variable pbar.
The initial description is set to "Initializing extraction...".
for index, row in pbar::

We now iterate over pbar.
project_display_name = ... and output_display_name = ...:

These variables are determined early in the loop to be used in the tqdm description.
pbar.set_description_str(f"Extracting {project_display_name} -> {output_display_name}"):

Before processing each item, the description of the progress bar is updated to show the current project folder name and the target output file name.
If an item is skipped (e.g., due to a missing unzip path or project directory), the description is also updated to reflect that.
With these changes, your tqdm progress bar line will dynamically update to something like: Extracting myproject -> myproject.txt: 10%|█ | 117/1174 [00:10<01:30, 11.2it/s]

The INFO level logs from within the extract_project function (like "Starting text extraction..." and "Successfully extracted...") will still print on their own lines, interspersed with the tqdm updates, which matches the behavior in your example. This should give you a clearer view of what's happening directly on the progress bar.

This is printing the output as follows:

root - INFO - Attempting to extract text for 1167 projects...

So that the progress bar doesn't progress, but is output repeatedly. I think that info logging within root that produces: root - INFO - Successfully extracted 41899 segments for adz to C:\ebible_data_pipeline\corpus\adz.txt Could be changed to be printed only if the logging is set to DEBUG. That will hopefully avoid interruptions to the tqdm output.


Gemini
You've got it! That's a common issue when mixing tqdm with frequent logging. The tqdm progress bar tries to control the current line of the terminal, and any other print or log to standard output/error can push it down, causing it to redraw.

Changing those specific log messages within the extract_project function to logging.debug is the right approach. This way, during normal operation (with logging at INFO level), these detailed messages won't print and interfere with tqdm. If you need to see them for debugging, you can set your root logger level to DEBUG.

Here's the diff to make that change in c:\ebible_code\ebible_code\ebible.py:

ebible.py

This looks like it's working great. The files are being extracted now.

I'd like to discuss ideas with you about the next steps for this. I have a script corpus_to_parquet.py that prepares a parquet file ready for uploading to huggingface as a dataset.

On the one hand I would like to get these updated files on HF asap, but I know that a few of them will need further improvements.

One set of improvements is running an external script called wb_normalize.py over the corpus files. This script will look for some common character encoding errors and correct them. I think I'll need a way to track changes to the corpus files that occur like that. Whether they are manually updated with corrections, or updated by a script. Now these files will be part of another repo called simply ebible. So the main tracking of details can happen there. However it would be good for this script to create a hash (using xxhash) of the extracted files and save that in the ebible_status.csv along with the data of the hash. It could include another column we can call wildebeest_hash along with wildebeest_hash_date. These would allow us to list which files were changed by the wildebeest script and which are left unchanged.

I guess this works for track that one specific known reason for changes. I'm not sure that it would work well for ad-hoc manual edits though.

Also, I have seen how much easier it is to use the script when tasks such as extracting are intergrated in. So maybe it would be a good idea to incorporate the wildebeest code so that it can be run and tracked through the ebible.py script.

Do you have advice about these ideas and issues?


Gemini
That's great news that the extraction is working well! It sounds like you've made significant progress in streamlining the initial data pipeline.

Moving on to cleaning and tracking changes is a very logical next step, especially before pushing to Hugging Face. Let's discuss your ideas about wb_normalize.py and hashing.

Hashing for Change Tracking (wildebeest_hash)
Adding a hash (like using xxhash) of the extracted corpus file to ebible_status.csv is an excellent idea for tracking whether a file has changed since the hash was last recorded.

Advice on the Hashing Idea:

Feasibility: This is definitely feasible and relatively straightforward to implement. xxhash is a good choice for speed and collision resistance for this purpose.
Purpose: The wildebeest_hash and wildebeest_hash_date columns would serve as a fingerprint of the corpus file (<translationId>.txt) at a specific point in time.
What it Tracks: As you noted, the hash tracks any change to the file's content. It won't tell you if the change was made by wb_normalize.py, a manual edit, or some other process. It only tells you that the file's content is different from when the hash was last calculated.
Usefulness: Despite not knowing the cause of the change, this is still very useful!
It lets you quickly identify which extracted files have been modified after the initial extraction pipeline run.
If you integrate wb_normalize.py later, you can calculate the hash after normalization. This hash then represents the "cleaned" state of the file. Any subsequent change (manual or otherwise) would be detected by comparing the current hash to this wildebeest_hash.
It helps ensure reproducibility up to the point the hash was calculated. If the hash matches, you know the file content is the same as it was on wildebeest_hash_date.
Manual Edits: You're right, manual edits are the trickiest part. If someone manually edits a file in the corpus/ directory after ebible.py has run and calculated the hash, the hash will no longer match on a subsequent run (if you add logic to check/recalculate). ebible.py wouldn't know why it changed.
Best Practice for Manual Edits: Ideally, manual edits to the corpus files should be managed in the target repository (ebible repo) using version control (Git). This provides a clear history of who made what change and when. The ebible_data_pipeline repo's role would be to generate the initial or automatically updated versions of these files. If manual edits are needed, they would happen in the ebible repo, and perhaps the ebible_data_pipeline would need a way to not overwrite manually edited files, or to merge changes (which is complex). For now, letting the hash detect the change is a good first step.
Code Suggestions for Hashing:

Add Columns: Modify STATUS_COLUMNS in ebible.py to include the new columns.

python
STATUS_COLUMNS = [
    "status_download_path", "status_download_date", "status_unzip_path",
    "status_unzip_date", "status_settings_xml_date", # Settings.xml creation date
    "status_extract_path", "status_extract_date", # For internally extracted and finalized text
    "status_last_error", "status_inferred_versification",
    "wildebeest_hash", # New column for the hash
    "wildebeest_hash_date" # New column for the hash date
]
# ALL_STATUS_COLUMNS will be updated automatically
Hashing Function: Add a helper function to calculate the hash. You'll need to install xxhash (pip install xxhash or add to your poetry dependencies).

python
import xxhash # Add this import at the top

def _calculate_file_hash(file_path: Path) -> Optional[str]:
    """Calculates the xxhash of a file."""
    if not file_path.is_file():
        return None
    try:
        h = xxhash.xxh64()
        with open(file_path, "rb") as f:
            # Read in chunks to handle large files efficiently
            while chunk := f.read(8192):
                h.update(chunk)
        return h.hexdigest()
    except Exception as e:
        logging.error(f"Error calculating hash for {file_path}: {e}")
        return None
Integrate Hash Calculation: Call this function after successful extraction in extract_and_finalize_texts.

ebible.py
        df.loc[index, 'status_extract_path'] = str(output_file_path.resolve())
        df.loc[index, 'status_extract_date'] = TODAY_STR

return df

plaintext
*Note:* I've added the `action_needed_hash` but initially only set it to `True` if `needs_extract` is true. You could add logic to re-hash based on date or missing hash if you want to periodically verify files even if they weren't re-extracted. For now, tying it to extraction is simple and effective.

Implement Hash Calculation Step: Add a function to perform the hashing for rows flagged with action_needed_hash.

# Add this function after extract_and_finalize_texts
def calculate_hashes(df: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.DataFrame:
    """Calculates hashes for files marked with action_needed_hash."""

    if count == 0:

        return df

    logging.info(f"Attempting to calculate hash for {count} files...")

    hashed_count = 0

        translation_id = row['translationId']
        extract_path_str = row['status_extract_path']

        if pd.isna(extract_path_str) or not Path(extract_path_str).is_file():
            logging.warning(f"Skipping hash for {translation_id}: No valid extract path found or file missing.")
            df.loc[index, 'status_last_error'] = "Hash skipped: Missing extract file"
            continue

        extract_file_path = Path(extract_path_str)

            # Keep previous error if it wasn't related to hashing
            if "Hash skipped" in str(df.loc[index, 'status_last_error']):
                 df.loc[index, 'status_last_error'] = np.nan
            hashed_count += 1
        else:

This implementation adds the hashing capability. The wildebeest_hash will store the hash of the file immediately after it was extracted (or re-extracted). If you later run wb_normalize.py manually on a file, the next time you run ebible.py (and assuming you add logic to check/recalculate hashes based on file modification time or missing hash), the hash calculation step would detect the change and update the hash. This would signal that the file is no longer in the state it was right after extraction by this script.

Integrating wb_normalize.py
Integrating the normalization step is a logical next step for a fully automated pipeline.

Advice on Integration:

Benefits:
Automation: The cleaning step becomes part of the standard pipeline run.
Consistency: Ensures normalization is applied consistently to all files processed by the script.
Status Tracking: You can add a status_normalize_date column to track when normalization was last applied by the script.
Order of Operations: You can control that normalization happens after extraction and before the final hash calculation.
Prerequisites: You need the core logic of wb_normalize.py. This could mean:
Copying the relevant function(s) into ebible.py (similar to what was done with extract_project).
Or, if wb_normalize.py is structured as a module or function that can be imported, you could import and call it directly.
Implementation Idea:
Add a new action action_needed_normalize in determine_actions. This would be true if action_needed_extract is true, or if status_normalize_date is old/missing.
Create a new function normalize_text_file(input_file_path: Path, output_file_path: Path) -> bool that encapsulates the wb_normalize.py logic. It would read the input, apply normalization, and write to the output.
Modify extract_and_finalize_texts or add a new step in main:
Option A (Simpler): extract_project writes to the final path (<translationId>.txt). Then, a new normalize_and_finalize_texts function (or a modification of extract_and_finalize_texts) reads this file, applies normalization, and overwrites the same file. The hash would then be calculated on this normalized file.
Option B (More complex, potentially safer): extract_project writes to a temporary or "raw_corpus" location. normalize_text_file reads from "raw_corpus" and writes to the final corpus/ location. The hash is calculated on the file in the final corpus/ location.
Update ebible_status.csv with status_normalize_date.
Order of Operations in main (if integrating normalization):

Initialize/Load Status
Scan Folders

This integrated approach provides the most control and best status tracking within ebible.py.

Summary of Advice:
Implement Hashing Now: Adding the wildebeest_hash and wildebeest_hash_date columns and calculating the hash after extraction is a valuable first step for tracking changes. The code suggestions above provide a way to do this.
Plan Normalization Integration: Integrating wb_normalize.py is a good long-term goal for a fully automated pipeline. You'll need access to the normalization logic and can follow the pattern used for integrating extraction (new action, new function, update status).
Manual Edits: For manual edits, rely on version control in the target repository (ebible repo). This pipeline is best suited for generating data automatically. If manual edits must happen in the output folders, the hash will detect them, but managing them further within this script is complex.
Let's start with the hashing changes. The provided diffs and function should get you most of the way there. Remember to install xxhash.

Can you check that all the changes required to add the hashing function to ebible.py were sucessfully integrated. There was a warning on some code snippets that they couldn't be parsed or automatically added.


Gemini
Okay, I've reviewed the c:\ebible_code\ebible_code\ebible.py file you provided to check if the hashing functionality was successfully integrated as discussed.

Based on the code, I can confirm that all the planned changes for adding the hashing function appear to be successfully integrated:

New Columns: The STATUS_COLUMNS list now includes "wildebeest_hash" and "wildebeest_hash_date".
Hashing Function: The _calculate_file_hash function using xxhash is present.
Integration in Extraction: The extract_and_finalize_texts function calls _calculate_file_hash after a successful extraction and updates the wildebeest_hash and wildebeest_hash_date columns for that row.
Action Needed: The determine_actions function includes the action_needed_hash column and sets it to True if action_needed_extract is True.
Hashing Step Function: The calculate_hashes function is present, which iterates through rows marked with action_needed_hash and calls _calculate_file_hash.
Call in Main: The main function calls calculate_hashes after the extract_and_finalize_texts step.
It looks like the integration was successful, and the code reflects the intended workflow for calculating and storing the hash of the extracted files immediately after extraction. The previous warnings might have been related to the process of generating or applying the diffs, but the final code seems to have all the pieces in place.

This is a solid step towards tracking changes to your corpus files!

The code, when run with the --hash-for-changes option should only ever add that hash to the wildebeest_hash column. However when the code is run without that option, any hashes that are missing from the status_extract_hash column should be calculated. Of course the status_extract_date should also be filled in.


Gemini
Okay, I understand! You want to refine the hashing logic so that:

When running normally, the script calculates and populates status_extract_hash and status_extract_hash_date if they are missing or if the underlying text file was just (re)extracted.
When running with the --hash-for-changes option, the script only calculates and populates wildebeest_hash and wildebeest_hash_date, leaving the status_extract_hash fields alone. This mode is specifically for checking/recording a hash for external modification tracking (like by wb_normalize.py).
This is a good separation of concerns for the different hash types.

Key changes and explanations:

determine_actions function:

action_needed_extract_hash: This is now only set to True if --hash-for-changes is not active, AND either the file was just extracted (needs_extract is true) OR status_extract_hash is missing (and the extract file exists).
action_needed_wildebeest_hash: This remains True only if --hash-for-changes is active.
extract_and_finalize_texts function:

The lines that previously calculated and stored wildebeest_hash and wildebeest_hash_date immediately after extraction have been removed. Hashing is now handled by dedicated functions later in the main workflow.
New calculate_extract_hashes function:

This function is specifically for calculating and populating status_extract_hash and status_extract_hash_date.
It iterates over rows where action_needed_extract_hash is true.
It uses its own tqdm progress bar.
Modified calculate_hashes function:

This function is now solely responsible for wildebeest_hash and wildebeest_hash_date.
It iterates based on action_needed_wildebeest_hash.
The tqdm description is updated to "Calculating Wildebeest Hashes".
main function:

After extract_and_finalize_texts, there's a conditional block:
If args.hash_for_changes is true, it calls calculate_hashes (for wildebeest_hash).
Otherwise (normal mode), it calls calculate_extract_hashes (for status_extract_hash).
This structure ensures that:

In normal runs, status_extract_hash is maintained for the files produced by the script.
When --hash-for-changes is used, only wildebeest_hash is touched, allowing you to fingerprint files for external change detection without interfering with the script's internal state tracking of its own generated files.

I think that the per-project .vrs files were meant to be produced so that the best versification can be determined and written to the project's Settings.xml file. This seems to suggest that we are trying to create a ParatextTextCorpus from the project before creating the Settings.xml file. (Unless the ParatextTextCorpus doesn't need a Settings.xml file and is used to create it - but I don't think that is the case.)

Is the code attempting to create Settings.xml files when run with the --allow-non-redistributable option? Are there issues with creating the Settings.xml file?

You've hit on a subtle but important point in the workflow, and your analysis is spot on!

Let's break down what's happening and why you're seeing that ERROR - Could not initialize ParatextTextCorpus for abp: The project does not contain a settings file.

The Core Issue: Circular Dependency in Logic

You are correct. The current logic in ebible.py (specifically within unzip_and_process_files) has a circular dependency when it comes to creating the project-specific .vrs file and then the Settings.xml file:

unzip_and_process_files calls generate_vrs_from_project: This function is intended to create <project_name>.vrs by analyzing the USFM files.
generate_vrs_from_project uses ParatextTextCorpus: The ParatextTextCorpus class from the machine library, by default, tries to load an existing Settings.xml file within the project directory to determine the project's versification, language, and file naming conventions.
Settings.xml is not yet created: At this point in the unzip_and_process_files workflow, the Settings.xml file has not yet been written for the newly unzipped project. It's supposed to be created after the .vrs file is generated and the best versification is determined.
This is why ParatextTextCorpus fails with "The project does not contain a settings file."

Consequences:

Failed .vrs Generation: Because ParatextTextCorpus can't initialize, generate_vrs_from_project likely fails or produces an incomplete/incorrect .vrs file (or no file at all, as seen by the subsequent "Project VRS file not found" warning).
Default Versification: When write_settings_file calls get_versification_with_scoring, it can't find the project-specific .vrs file (because it wasn't created properly). Therefore, the scoring mechanism defaults to "English" versification.
Incorrect Settings.xml: The Settings.xml file is then written with this default (and potentially incorrect for the specific translation) versification.
Does --allow-non-redistributable affect Settings.xml creation?

Indirectly, yes, but it's not the root cause. The --allow-non-redistributable flag simply allows projects marked as non-redistributable to enter the processing pipeline (download, unzip, etc.). The issue with Settings.xml creation is inherent in the order of operations for any project being processed through the unzip_and_process_files stage, regardless of its redistributable status.
So, yes, the code is attempting to create Settings.xml files for non-redistributable projects if they are allowed into the pipeline, and it's encountering the same logical problem.
How to Fix This?

The key is to allow ParatextTextCorpus to initialize without requiring a Settings.xml file when we are in the process of creating that Settings.xml file (or its prerequisite .vrs file).

The ParatextTextCorpus constructor can accept a project_settings_parser argument. If you don't want it to look for Settings.xml, you can pass None or a parser that doesn't rely on the file. However, a more straightforward approach for generate_vrs_from_project is to ensure it can work even if Settings.xml isn't present, perhaps by falling back to a default versification for the initial parsing of USFM files just to get verse counts.

Looking at the machine.corpora.ParatextTextCorpus and UsfmFileTextCorpus (which ParatextTextCorpus uses), they can often infer a lot directly from the USFM files if a Settings.xml isn't strictly enforced or if a default versification is provided programmatically.

Suggested Change in settings_file.py:

The ParatextTextCorpus in generate_vrs_from_project needs to be initialized in a way that doesn't strictly depend on an existing Settings.xml for its initial pass. The machine library often allows specifying a Versification object directly or has defaults.

Let's modify generate_vrs_from_project in c:\ebible_code\ebible_code\settings_file.py to explicitly provide a default versification (e.g., English) if Settings.xml is not found. This default is only for the purpose of reading the USFM files to count verses; the actual best versification will still be determined by scoring later.

    except Exception as e:
        logger.error(f"Could not initialize ParatextTextCorpus for {project_name}: {e}")
        return None

Explanation of the Change:

Check for Settings.xml: Before initializing ParatextTextCorpus, we check if Settings.xml exists.
Provide Default Versification: If Settings.xml is not found (which will be the case during the initial run for a new project), we initialize ParatextTextCorpus by explicitly passing versification=Versification.get_builtin(VersificationType.ENGLISH). This tells the corpus to use the "English" versification rules for parsing the USFM files. This is a safe default for the purpose of simply iterating through verses to generate the .vrs file.
Existing Settings.xml: If Settings.xml does exist (e.g., during an --update-settings run or a re-run), ParatextTextCorpus will use it as before.
Why this should work:

generate_vrs_from_project can now successfully initialize ParatextTextCorpus even for a brand-new project without Settings.xml.
It can then iterate through the USFM files and correctly generate the <project_name>.vrs file based on the actual content of the translation.
get_versification_with_scoring will then find this newly created .vrs file.
The scoring mechanism will compare this project-specific .vrs against standard versifications.
write_settings_file will then create the Settings.xml with the correctly determined best versification, rather than defaulting to English due to an earlier failure.
This change addresses the circular dependency and should lead to more accurate Settings.xml files being generated.

Which has initialized the ParatextTextCorpus with the default English versification. Then there is an error with an unexpected keyword argument 'versification'

Can you help to debug this?


Gemini
You've correctly identified the sequence of events and the immediate cause of the error!

The error message TypeError: __init__() got an unexpected keyword argument 'versification' is very clear: the ParatextTextCorpus constructor in the version of the sil-machine library you are using does not accept a versification keyword argument.

Here's the breakdown:

Your Goal: In generate_vrs_from_project (within settings_file.py), you need to read the USFM files to create a project-specific .vrs file. This .vrs file is then used to determine the best standard versification, which is finally written into Settings.xml.

The Problem: When a project is first unzipped, Settings.xml doesn't exist.

Previous Attempt & Error: You (or a previous iteration of the code) tried to handle the missing Settings.xml by explicitly telling ParatextTextCorpus to use a default versification:

python
corpus = ParatextTextCorpus(str(project_path), versification=Versification.get_builtin(VersificationType.ENGLISH))
This line is what's causing the TypeError.

How ParatextTextCorpus (usually) works:

The ParatextTextCorpus constructor typically looks like ParatextTextCorpus(project_path_str, include_markers=False).
Internally, it uses a FileParatextProjectSettingsParser to load settings.
If Settings.xml is missing, FileParatextProjectSettingsParser is designed to return a default set of project settings, which includes a default versification (usually "English" / VersificationType.ENGLISH).
So, ParatextTextCorpus should be able to initialize and use a default versification even if Settings.xml is not present, without needing an explicit versification argument in its constructor.
The Fix:

The solution is to remove the versification keyword argument when initializing ParatextTextCorpus in settings_file.py. The corpus will then rely on its internal mechanism to handle a missing Settings.xml by using default settings.

Here's the suggested diff for c:\ebible_code\ebible_code\settings_file.py:

        # It uses its internal FileParatextProjectSettingsParser, which should default
        # to English versification if Settings.xml is missing.
         else:
             corpus = ParatextTextCorpus(str(project_path))
     except Exception as e:

Explanation of the Change:

The line corpus = ParatextTextCorpus(str(project_path), versification=Versification.get_builtin(VersificationType.ENGLISH)) has been removed.
The call is simplified to corpus = ParatextTextCorpus(str(project_path)).
The log message has been updated to reflect that ParatextTextCorpus itself will handle the defaulting.
After this change:

The TypeError should be resolved.
ParatextTextCorpus will be initialized. If Settings.xml is missing, its internal parser should provide default settings, including a default versification (likely English).
The rest of the generate_vrs_from_project function will proceed, creating the .vrs file based on the USFM content (parsed using the default versification).
get_versification_with_scoring will then use this generated .vrs file to determine the actual best versification.
write_settings_file will create the Settings.xml with this correctly determined versification.
This approach aligns with how the sil-machine library is typically designed to handle missing settings files and should fix the immediate error while maintaining the logic for accurate versification determination.

If, after this change, you see the error Could not initialize ParatextTextCorpus for ...: The project does not contain a settings file. resurface, it would imply that the specific version or configuration of ParatextTextCorpus or FileParatextProjectSettingsParser in your environment is not defaulting as expected when Settings.xml is missing. However, fixing the TypeError is the necessary first step.

You've pinpointed the error perfectly! The UnboundLocalError: local variable 'corpus' referenced before assignment occurs because the corpus variable is only assigned within the else block of your if not settings_xml_path.exists(): check. If Settings.xml doesn't exist, the else block is skipped, and corpus is never initialized before being used in the loop for text_row in corpus:.

The ParatextTextCorpus initialization should happen regardless of whether Settings.xml exists, as it's designed to use default settings if the file is missing.

Here's the corrected code for c:\ebible_code\ebible_code\settings_file.py:

settings_file.py
-3
+2
        # We can explicitly pass a default versification if Settings.xml is missing
        settings_xml_path = project_path / "Settings.xml"
        if not settings_xml_path.exists():
            logger.info(f"  Settings.xml not found in {project_name}. ParatextTextCorpus will use default settings (likely English versification).")
            logger.info(f"  Settings.xml not found in {project_name}. ParatextTextCorpus will attempt to use default settings.")
        # ParatextTextCorpus constructor does not take 'versification'.
        # It uses its internal FileParatextProjectSettingsParser, which should default
        # to English versification if Settings.xml is missing.
        else:
            corpus = ParatextTextCorpus(str(project_path))
        corpus = ParatextTextCorpus(str(project_path)) # Initialize corpus regardless of Settings.xml presence
    except Exception as e:
        logger.error(f"Could not initialize ParatextTextCorpus for {project_name}: {e}")
        return None

Explanation of the Change:

The line corpus = ParatextTextCorpus(str(project_path)) has been moved out of the else block.
It is now executed unconditionally if the try block doesn't immediately fail (e.g., due to project_path being invalid, which is checked earlier).
The logger.info message when Settings.xml is not found remains, correctly informing the user that ParatextTextCorpus will attempt to use its default settings.
With this change, corpus will always be assigned if ParatextTextCorpus(str(project_path)) successfully initializes (which it should, by using defaults if Settings.xml is missing), thus resolving the UnboundLocalError.

Is there a wider problem here, with the project level .vrs files not being saved? I'm not sure, because I don't think the code has ever saved per-project .vrs files. There was a version of the code that calculated all the verses present for every project and stored that infomation in a .csv file in ebible_data/metadata/compare_versifications.csv That was created with the compare_versifications.py script. While the verse counts for each chapter present are required for calculating the best versification, and they might be useful in this comparision csv file we don't need to store them individually per-project.

The error I see now is: Unzipping/Processing: 4%|████▍ | 6/134 [00:00<00:10, 12.41it/s]root - INFO - Processing ksp: Unzipping C:\ebible_data_pipeline\downloads\ksp--2025-04-30.zip to C:\ebible_data_pipeline\private_projects\ksp root - INFO - Successfully unzipped to C:\ebible_data_pipeline\private_projects\ksp root - INFO - Renaming USFM files in C:\ebible_data_pipeline\private_projects\ksp root - INFO - Renamed 11 USFM files. root - INFO - Generating project .vrs file for ksp settings_file - INFO - Generating project .vrs for: ksp at C:\ebible_data_pipeline\private_projects\ksp settings_file - INFO - Settings.xml not found in ksp.

However it's possible that a review of how the code is calculating the best versification would be worthwhile.

Okay, let's address this error and clarify the role of the project-level .vrs files.

You're absolutely right; the error settings_file - ERROR - Could not initialize ParatextTextCorpus for ksp: The project does not contain a settings file. points directly back to the circular dependency issue we discussed. The generate_vrs_from_project function is trying to use ParatextTextCorpus, which expects Settings.xml to exist, but Settings.xml hasn't been created yet for a new project.

Clarifying the Role of Project-Level .vrs Files:

Yes, the current design does intend to create a <project_name>.vrs file within each project directory during the unzip_and_process_files step.
This project-specific .vrs file is crucial because it contains the actual verse counts per chapter as found in the USFM files of that specific translation.
The get_versification_with_scoring function then reads this project-specific .vrs file to get the project's verse data. It compares this data against the verse data from the standard built-in versifications (English, Original, etc.) to calculate a similarity score.
The standard versification with the highest score is then selected as the "inferred versification" and written into the project's Settings.xml file.
So, while the compare_versifications.csv file (generated by the separate compare_versifications.py script) compares these verse counts, the raw verse count data for a specific project is intended to be stored in its <project_name>.vrs file.
The error you're seeing means the first step (generating the project .vrs file) is failing because ParatextTextCorpus cannot initialize without Settings.xml.

The Fix:

Since ParatextTextCorpus is strictly requiring Settings.xml even when we don't want it to, we need to use a different approach within generate_vrs_from_project to read the USFM files and count verses. The machine.corpora library provides UsfmFileTextCorpus, which is designed to read individual USFM files and doesn't depend on Settings.xml. We can use this to iterate through all .usfm and .SFM files in the project directory.

Here's the corrected code for c:\ebible_code\ebible_code\settings_file.py:

settings_file.py
-11
+10
from collections import defaultdict
from datetime import datetime
import re

from machine.scripture import VersificationType # Ensure VersificationType is imported here
from machine.corpora import ParatextTextCorpus
from machine.scripture import Versification, VersificationType, book_id_to_number

        logger.error(f"Project path does not exist or is not a directory: {project_path}")
        return None

    # Use UsfmFileTextCorpus which does not strictly require Settings.xml.
    # Provide a default versification (English) for parsing purposes, as the project's
    # true versification is what we are trying to determine.
    # We need to read both .usfm and .SFM files.
    try:
        # Attempt to initialize ParatextTextCorpus.
        # If Settings.xml doesn't exist, it might raise an error or use defaults.
        # We can explicitly pass a default versification if Settings.xml is missing
        settings_xml_path = project_path / "Settings.xml"
        if not settings_xml_path.exists():
            logger.info(f"  Settings.xml not found in {project_name}. ParatextTextCorpus will attempt to use default settings.")
        # ParatextTextCorpus constructor does not take 'versification'.
        # It uses its internal FileParatextProjectSettingsParser, which should default
        # to English versification if Settings.xml is missing.
        corpus = ParatextTextCorpus(str(project_path)) # Initialize corpus regardless of Settings.xml presence
        from machine.corpora import UsfmFileTextCorpus # Import UsfmFileTextCorpus
        default_vrs_for_parsing = Versification.get_builtin(VersificationType.ENGLISH)
        corpus_usfm = UsfmFileTextCorpus(str(project_path), file_pattern="*.[uU][sS][fF][mM]", versification=default_vrs_for_parsing)
        corpus_sfm = UsfmFileTextCorpus(str(project_path), file_pattern="*.[sS][fF][mM]", versification=default_vrs_for_parsing)
        corpus = corpus_usfm.union(corpus_sfm) # Combine corpora from both file types
    except Exception as e:
        logger.error(f"Could not initialize ParatextTextCorpus for {project_name}: {e}")
        return None

Explanation of Changes:

We import UsfmFileTextCorpus from machine.corpora.
Inside the try block in generate_vrs_from_project, we replace the ParatextTextCorpus initialization with two UsfmFileTextCorpus initializations: one for .usfm files and one for .SFM files.
We provide a default Versification.get_builtin(VersificationType.ENGLISH) to UsfmFileTextCorpus. This is necessary for the corpus reader to correctly interpret verse references in the USFM files, but it's just a default for this parsing step, not the final determined versification.
We use the .union() method to combine the corpora from both file types so we iterate over all relevant files in the project.
The rest of the logic (iterating for text_row in corpus:, extracting text_row.ref, and populating verse_data) remains the same, as both ParatextTextCorpus and UsfmFileTextCorpus yield TextRow objects.
This change bypasses the need for Settings.xml during the .vrs file generation step, allowing the script to correctly create the project-specific .vrs file. Once that file exists, the get_versification_with_scoring function can load it and proceed with determining the best standard versification and writing the Settings.xml.

This should resolve the "The project does not contain a settings file." error during the unzip/processing phase.
